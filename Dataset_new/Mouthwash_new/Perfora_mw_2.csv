3.0,December,2023,neutral,"It's been over 10-12 days since I started using this product and to be honest I couldn't see any changes.Before I started using this, I got my teeth cleaned by the dentist however there were a few yellow stains on my teeth and I thought this could help me with that. Since I consume a lot of coffee and tea, my teeth stain very easily.Ever since I started using this product, I have reduced my caffeine intake, I have also started brushing my teeth thrice a day, I drink a lot of water, and more than usual but still I can't see any visible change.I don't know what to say, I read reviews of this product before buying it, and since most people have given positive reviews, I decided to go for it.Well, I am gonna keep using it for a month and see if this really works."

2.0,April,2023,negative,Did not worked. It's not worth for a penny. It is not giving any effect on teeth yellowish removal. Please don't waste your time and money buying such disgusting products. Better choice charcoal based product or use row charcoal
1.0,November,2023,positive,Its depends on person. For me I have got sensitive teeth fter using for 5 days. I don think its that good to use on daily basis.
1.0,July,2023,negative,"I am not at all happy with the product. It made the inside of my mouth very rough, also occasional bleeding in gums and the inside lining of my mouth which took time to heal and very painful. Also I did not observe any whitening of my teeth after using it for more than 15days and brushing twice daily. I will recommend not to use it. I have stopped using it already. Now I am using normal toothpaste and thankfully there is no more bleeding and painful gums."

2.0,May,2022,negative,First time Used this powder with a toothbrush and felt that it would damage gum in long run. Applying using finger would be better. Would update after a  couple of months.
1.0,October,2022,negative,"I have been using this for almost a month now with the hope of getting rid of yellowishness, not for any stains in particular. Absolutely no change in teeth colour till now. Moreover, it does not give even a sense of freshness after brushing with this powder.
