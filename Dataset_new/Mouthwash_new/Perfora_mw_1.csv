3.0,February,2024,positive,I like everything about the brand just that the lemon mint taste for cavity is little sour else everything is great about the product and as well as brand
3.0,December,2023,positive,Avg product
3.0,November,2023,positive,Ordered Perfora mouthwash Lemon Mint (mild) . Didn’t like the after taste. Packaging and branding is good though.
3.0,October,2023,negative,"The freshness is decently lasting but it's quite bitter and sharp, especially for people with sensitivity in gums/teeth."
3.0,October,2023,negative,"It's mild and doesn't burn the mouth, but the effectiveness is only for a few hours."
2.0,October,2023,negative,"In the top ingredients of this mouthwash, you will find 'hydrogenated castor oil', which is ugly Trans fat.Sure, mouthwash is not food—but some will remain in your mouth after wash.Using this product will nearly make sure that all your healthy eating habits are overridden by using this 'health' product.PERFORA, please use normal castor oil, NOT hydrogenated castor oil, as hydrogenation is NOT contributing to the product or effectiveness, it's just a way of cutting cost and increasing shelf life."
3.0,June,2023,neutral,"No doubt the mouthwash is different from regular product with no artificial colour, flavor, alcohol. However, cost is not justified and the results are not visible. I guess post SharkTank there is a boom in sale, but this will not be the case forever unless competitive pricing."
3.0,September,2023,positive,Ok
2.0,November,2023,negative,"It does freshennyour mouth..no strong scent ..After using it for a month, I will not recommend it..Yellowed the teeth badly..Didn't work for me.."
3.0,February,2024,negative,Alchohol free so u dont have to have a pungent taste while gargling the mouthwash and also have a nice lemon mint formula
1.0,February,2024,positive,"It only make u fresh for 1 hour, & it is also very costly"
3.0,January,2023,positive,"It is a good product.  Unlike other major brand of mouthwash, it is not much soapy.  It seems a healthy mouthwash.  Packaging is also attractive. Smell is great. It may sting cause of the acids in it.But now when I use it, it gives me ulcers on my inner cheeks.  My wife also complained of the same."
3.0,May,2023,negative,"Burns while squishing & taste is horrible for both,after taste is pathetic too"
3.0,March,2023,negative,"Doesn't taste good, leaves weird taste in mouth but it is definitely natural because after keeping it for some days in my bathroom, ants were attracted to this while this never happened to other mouth washes."
1.0,February,2024,negative,Waste of money
2.0,September,2023,negative,Its too bitter either for gargling or oil pulling during the morning. I prefer using other Ayurveda recommended Sesame oil as that leaves a bitter after effect.
3.0,February,2024,positive,
3.0,December,2023,positive,"I like the freshness, fragrances and no hard like other rinse. Highly recommendable. Moreover it's alcoholic free mouth wash. I love to use it 💖🤩"

3.0,February,2023,positive,Bitter taste
1.0,December,2023,negative,Not good
2.0,April,2023,negative,"Didn't clean the plaque, leaves a tangy after taste and contains citric acid which will dissolve enamel in long term. Not good for teeth."
2.0,May,2023,negative,It leaves mouth oily with a very bad taste. Mouth wash is far better than this.
2.0,February,2023,positive,Nice lemony mint taste and fresh mouth feel  but gave burning sensation.
2.0,October,2022,negative,"Didn't like it. Taste is bad, strange colour of the month wash. Cost wise, expensive, this is a 300 ml mouth wash. For the same pice, one can get a 500 ml better quality mouth wash.Overall, not a good product."
3.0,July,2022,negative,Its okay. But not great.
3.0,March,2022,positive,
1.0,August,2023,negative,"Not worth the money, you can make better than this at home, not long lasting"
2.0,April,2022,negative,For the first time when you use this product you’ll feel you are having juice - lime and a tinge of mint - it’s that tastyHowever it’s so mild that in 5mns you’ll hardly feel you have rinsed your mouth with a mouthwash and it’s pricey tooI wouldn’t recommend it
1.0,September,2023,negative,"Very bad taste , bitter"
1.0,June,2023,negative,Got the product with broken cap seal.Had to throw the product.The outer box also had a cello tape put on it.
1.0,June,2023,negative,It has a unbearable burning sensation. Can't even hold for 10s. And the taste is also quite bad. No freshness after use
3.0,February,2022,positive,Flavor I like
1.0,April,2023,negative,"The taste is so bad that after the first time you use it, you keep on wondering how would you manage to finish the entire bottle. Then it strikes you that it was a pack of three!"
1.0,May,2023,negative,"Worst cheap leaky bottle cap, n price too highProduct not good nor refreshing or effective.👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎 . But toothpaste is good and refreshing 👍👍👍👍👍👍"
3.0,September,2023,positive,"This mouthwash from Perfora is no doubt a better product comparatively in the market, but, frankly, needs better taste for rinsing in the mouth."
1.0,April,2023,negative,"I've got mouth ulcer within 2 uses ,i felt nauseous after using it and I've never experienced any freshness after using it. Don't waste your hard earned money on this product."
2.0,June,2022,negative,"Did not like the product. Packaging is a bit weird too, flavour ain’t good"
1.0,February,2023,positive,"Few seconds after Mouthwash, I feel my mouth is full of salt. It has a very salty taste which gives an unpleasant experience. If that can be improved pls."
2.0,February,2022,negative,Doesn't taste of lemon or mint... But its mote like bitter lemon
2.0,August,2022,positive,Good product
1.0,July,2022,positive,
1.0,October,2022,negative,"Very bad taste after it’s use ! I can guarantee , you just can’t hold it in your mouth for a second. Super sad product :("
1.0,December,2022,positive,Beware the Thyme mint is too strong. Very uncomfortable. Don't gargle.
1.0,January,2022,positive,"The packaging was good. I ordered the Mint flavour. It doesn't taste good and doesn't feel refreshing at all. If my money could be refunded I would gladly take it,"
1.0,December,2021,neutral,Well in the name of herbal they changed double of its competitors.No longevity at all
1.0,April,2022,negative,Bad taste. Have to force myself to use it
1.0,February,2022,negative,Failed 😢 item.. don't buy it.
2.0,May,2023,negative,This was a okaish productDidn't liked the tate of the mouthwash very much and when compared with other mouthwashes it was niceIt just tastes like a soft drink - limca😂Btw nice packaging
1.0,November,2023,negative,"It's too strong and even if diluted, it leaves my teeth and gums feeling extremely sensitive. Both flavours Mild and Strong didn't work for me."
2.0,April,2022,positive,"Yes, I use this product for freshness and also the test quality is good and its value for money in this price range."
2.0,February,2022,positive,I am using this for my research. I think it's quite nice and worth the money. You should give a try.
1.0,September,2022,negative,Product quantity is not consistent. Each pack differs. When i bought the morning and night toothpaste second time they tasted different and did not lather at all. The mouth wash bottle's bottom was filled with some flakes and residue after being left for a month untouched. Better to avoid such inconsistent quality products.
1.0,February,2022,negative,"When Asked a question seller/manufacturer is denying that Pentylene Glycol & Potassium SorbateHere is the reply.1. Pentylene Glycol - this is a solvent.2. Potassium Sorbate - food-grade stability enhancer i.e. used for preservation.Obviously chemicals have a purpose. Potassium Sorbate is a preservative(calling it ""used for preservation"") as admitting by seller. But still they are putting claims that no chemical preservatives and chemicals.They say it is Approved as GRAS. YES I KNOW. All chemicals used by any mainstream food or cosmetic products are approved chemicals. Otherwise they will not be able to use it.I won't get into how they got it approved and how it is still bad for us.Bottomline is we don't want to use chemicals of any sort or preservatives regardless if it approved.Many toxic chemicals pesticides for examples are approved.Amazon please take action against this listing and make the seller remove these misleading claims.They can say we use ""approved chemicals""(which everyone uses btw) but they cannot say NO chemicals and No Preservatives it is a lie"
1.0,December,2021,negative,Very bad product  ordered from another account it smells bad so i cancelled it not good or worth to buy this product.
,on,22,positive,"This had a sting like drying dry mouth making killing good bacteria in mouth alcohol mouthwash....Not everyone can do Hyaluronic acid , that's good for anyone to know. Relatively low but can happen. Best for rejenerating gum tissue, receding gums and peridontis.I'm sorry but I'm happy with coconut oil pulling mouthwash only and I'll never change my mind or change back ever. I know should of got your coconut oil pulling one instead...sorry."
,on,3,negative,"I’ve done all pulling for years now and this formula literally makes me gag. Luckily I try to do it in the morning before I ate anything so that I don’t throw up. The composition of it is off. I’ve used pure coconut oil mainly for my oil pulley, but wanted to try, a different formula, I would not recommend this. It’s too thick and I think all the extra added ingredients makes it that way. I also don’t necessarily feel a feeling that I normally get when I’m doing straight up coconut oil."
,on,1,negative,"This product has no fluoride or any other active ingredients to prevent cavities, gingivitis, plaque, etc. It doesn't bubble up and clean my teeth at all. It's pretty much just lemon essential oil diluted in water. It smells okay but the smell doesn't last very long at all. You're much better off using regular products that actually benefit your teeth instead of this, this was just a waste of money for a tiny bottle."
,on,12,negative,"This pulling oil was disappointing.  It arrived solid and despite being in a warm home for a week, it’s still chunky and lumpy.  The oil is someone gritty in the mouth and doesn’t easily melt like other pulling oils I’ve tried. The mint is not very strong at all.  Can’t get over how gritty and chunky this oil is."
,on,14,negative,"Well I’ve only used this 3 times so far but I can already tell a difference in my gums. The redness has gone down and the bleeding is way less. Just after 3 uses! So I love that! The problem is that it tastes SOOOO bad. It coats your tongue in a thick layer of oil and sunscreen flavor and it doesn’t go away after swishing with water OR brushing your teeth. You literally have to scrape every millimeter of your tongue to get that awful, disgusting taste out. Today I -literally- threw up because the taste would not get off of my tongue. I wish I was exaggerating. If you already do not like coconut flavor, you will HATE this. However, the coconut oil is necessary because it has great benefits. I think I’m going to suffer through it and just have something ready to scrub my tongue the SECOND I spit because I think the benefits do outweigh that terrible taste. I just probably won’t buy this brand again."
,on,2,neutral,"The Perfora Oil Pulling solution has some notable characteristics. Its thickness gives a substantial feel during use, but unfortunately, it leaves a lingering aftertaste that might not suit everyone. Despite consistent use, I haven't observed significant results in terms of improved oral health. While the promise of a coconut mint flavor is there, the overall experience falls short of expectations. It's worth considering personal preferences and expectations before committing to this particular oil pulling product."
,on,5,neutral,Do care for this at all. Nothing like the others I have tried. Thought the flavor sounded different but it hardly has a taste at all. Will be going back to what I was using!
,on,11,positive,"I can't quite figure out how to describe this flavor. It's like candle wax and sunscreen except grosser! I was using Gurunada pulling oil before I tried this, and that flavor was genuinely good. It was also thinner which made it easier to swish. I've also used plain coconut oil before, and that flavor was significantly better. This stuff just tastes like chemicals. I will not be purchasing again. It's bad, but not bad enough to return for something like this."
,on,29,positive,Bought the product used a few times. No longer a liquid. It crystallizes after being open
,on,9,positive,"Firstly, it is a solid product meant to be poured out of a bottle. You need to soak the bottle in hot water for 5 minutes in order to get it out. But the real kicker is that it tastes like an ashtray. So gross!"
,on,21,negative,"This oil was super thick and I couldn't stomach the plastic taste long enough to use for the recommended swish time. and after a week, the container and product solidified and wouldn't melt back down into an oil. Would not recommend."
,on,5,negative,Product is grainy and turned to grainy goo within one day of opening. Do not recommend it. Not sure if it is defective but has horrible taste and after taste.
,on,14,negative,"The texture is thick and chunky, made me gag"
,on,17,neutral,I don’t like the taste of this at all. It tastes like grass.
,on,20,neutral,I liked the taste of the oil but the thickness I couldn't manage. I used it to help with gums and teeth
,on,19,negative,The product is no longer liquid. I ordered 2 bottles and they are both solid.
