3.0,May,2023,positive,When I bought is product for 1st time it cost me around 200 rs and for that price the product was amazing. But this time I bought this same product at 329 price. And for this price I think it is overpriced. Otherwise the product is very good for our mouth hygiene.

3.0,March,2022,positive,"Product is good for your health if you are using once twice in a week when your oral health is in average condition. However, it should be avoided for daily use, as it will kill all of friendly bacteria of the mouth. Lack of friendly mouth bacteria will be reduce your nitrous oxide production in the body.Low nitrous oxide level is one cause in increaseof  the blood pressure of the body."
