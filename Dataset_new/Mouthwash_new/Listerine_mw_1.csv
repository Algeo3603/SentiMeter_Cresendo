3.0,January,2024,positive,It good for rinsing teeth before sleep. You can use it after drink and it will hide the alcoholic smell .
3.0,November,2023,positive,It's very much acrid in taste. For me 'mild taste' flavour bottles are far better than these.
2.0,February,2024,positive,Don't waste money either your elichi is the best
3.0,October,2023,neutral,Taste is differ
3.0,October,2023,positive,Like
3.0,August,2023,positive,Good to use twice weekly.Of you use daily there might be chance of damaging your gums.Too acidic for gums.But keeps the plaques away.
1.0,January,2024,positive,
2.0,January,2023,negative,"Someone mentioned that Listerine Mouthwash is a hedonic product, but I'm not sure as it isn't ""pleasant"". If you're using a good toothpaste, you really don't need to use this despite what all it claims as a good toothpaste would surely do all of that. Of course, unless you're just looking for something to spend on..... or some other exceptional reason. I won't be able to use toothpaste for an unspecified time and so I decided to brush (without toothpaste) and then use this. But this has a few problems. First of all, rinsing it after 30 seconds may cause some burning sensation. However, that's not too painful. In product description, it's mentioned that for best results, one shouldn't rinse mouth with water or eat and drink anything for 30 minutes post rinse. As it contains alcohol, it's not advisable to swallow it. I find that particularly inconvenient. Colgate Plax claims to have 0% alcohol and cause no burning sensation, so if that's true, I may go for it next time (although it's relatively expensive). Wish I'd done the research before! Hope that I can start using paste again soon. Have to use the 3 bottles though as it's not returnable. As a pack of 3 was cheaper than buying just one, I wisely bought what seemed to be cheaper! How was I supposed to know, right?!"
2.0,October,2023,negative,"Too harsh in use. I would strongly recommend ko avoid it, and if you still want, purchase it from local shop. In addition, the packaging was also not enough. The box was damaged. Thanks to amazon they processed the refund. I guess it will be credited in my account in 1-2 days."
3.0,July,2023,positive,Just ok
3.0,May,2020,negative,"Purchased For : Rs. 250/-Have been using this product for approx. 2 months now & it has been a decent experience.Good things:1. Strong Bad breath protection & freshness. The cooling effect of the mouthwash lasts quite long.2. Cost effective. Retail price of the product is Approx Rs. 125/- per bottle. Buying 2+1 pack does save money.3. Seal tight packaging. No leaks/defects observed.Cons:1. Contains Alcohol as one of the ingredients though exact percentage is not mentioned. Nevertheless, the alcohol tends to give strong burning sensation inside the mouth.2. Not meant for people having oral problems like Xerostomia (Dry mouth) due to alcohol present.3. Not meant for people having sensitive teeth & gums as the burning sensation can cause severe irritation. Also, due to this can't be shared with children.Conclusion: Initially I didn't care the presence of Alcohol in a mouthwash as I always felt that the burning sensation is meant to fight bad bacteria & breath which isn't always the case.Non-Alcohol based mouthwash can also achieve the same effect.Hence, switching to Colgate Plax after this.Overall, Not Recommended!."
3.0,June,2023,positive,Value for money
3.0,May,2023,positive,Good product
1.0,December,2023,negative,"Don't buy if you are allegric to alcohol. Also it smells and tastes weird, I had headache after using it."
3.0,March,2023,positive,"Has a strong artificial flavour and colour. Bought as a mouthwash, but using it to wash my night-guard."
3.0,April,2023,positive,Best ressort
3.0,August,2022,neutral,The flavour is so heavy that it almost burns of you try to gargle without mixing some water. Freshness is ok and longevity is the usual. Nothing extraordinary there. Personally I am not a fan of the flavour. May be next time I will try a different flavour.
1.0,December,2023,negative,Weird smell maybe because of alcohol. My previous had no alcohol. So the switch was bad and worse is I bought the bottles.
1.0,July,2023,negative,The day when I used this it was very pathetic..my whole mouth had sore and now I am not satisfied with this mouth wash and even feeling disappointed for using this all the three not came on my usage becoz for more than two weeks I was in pain and I never recommend this to anyone becoz of very strong which burns my mouth
3.0,June,2022,positive,Don't have toouch to say it's a nice mouth wash that keep the smell for long hours.The only issue is with the pack design which breaks when whe travel on compression.But good. Giving 3 stars for the design flaw in the bottle
1.0,November,2023,negative,Bad and irritating taste I opened yesterday .Have to return the the product.
1.0,October,2023,negative,Taste is very poor didn't like it.  Please check it all details care full return not able fir this product
2.0,April,2023,positive,3 order kiye the jisme 2 hi aaye great chori krne ki had hoti hai
1.0,November,2023,negative,Creates bubble in mouth. Quality is not good. Go for cavity fighter.
3.0,October,2022,positive,Feels like burning inside
2.0,February,2023,negative,It is very diluted and not concentrated like my last product. Doesn't feel freshness after using it. Seams dublicate product.
1.0,October,2023,negative,"Maybe we received wrong products , itâ€™s doesnâ€™t give freshness"
3.0,March,2021,negative,Don't go for this if you don't want a burning sensation in your mouth. In bottle direction they have told that rinse in mouth for 30 seconds but i guarantee that you can't even hold for 15 seconds it's burning sensation is heavy  and mainly it contains alcohol.
3.0,July,2021,positive,I prefer the original flavor. I wanted to try this and found it too sweet. Funny a mouthwash supposed to fight against germs and cavities but sugared out?
1.0,October,2023,negative,Tastes like keroseneâ€¦.bad experience
3.0,August,2022,positive,Ok
3.0,December,2020,positive,Doesn't matter what the instructions say: DO NOT! I repeat DO NOT use undiluted solution. While the flavour is good but the product is too strong and using it without mixing it with water will hurt your gums in the long term.
2.0,January,2019,negative,"Contains Alcohol and other strong chemicals(see attached images of ingredients) and hence not recommended. Might prove harmful rather than good for your mouth. See attached images for list of ingredients and precautions (not to swollen) Would rather recommend Colgate Plax non alcoholic mouth wash. Also found that MRP was manipulated, same month manufactured Listerine was locally available on which MRP mentioned was 109/-, but in these MRP mentioned is 125. So in a way buy 2 get 1 offer is little confusing as for 3rd bottle they are already including some cost of it. Anyway would recommend rather to buy and try a small bottle for local market, then if suits you, you can go for such 2+1 offers."
3.0,March,2021,positive,"It is good but too strong and mouth start burning due to alcohol, if you are ok with alcohol then go for it otherwise use Colgate mouthwash for non alcoholic mouthwash"
2.0,October,2017,negative,"I had been to my dentist recently and when he came to know that my family uses listerine he asked us to stop and use normal saline water (warer+salt) if need be. He said though thereâ€™s a hype surrounding it, it does more harm than good. It also kills good bacteria, along with the bad ones.And itâ€™s a big no for kids. So I canceled my prime subscription.I would suggest that you consult your doctor. Every body is different and need different treatments. So if your doctor has no apprehension you can very well use it.Now I donâ€™t know what star rating to give ðŸ¤”.â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”This was my previous reviewItâ€™s a very good mouth wash, I have used other brands but I prefer listerine. I have used both the green and the blue. I feel blue to be better in terms of freshness and smell(itâ€™s my take).Even my kids use it after their daily routine but  half cap and diluted.Give it a try. You would feel and stay fresh."
3.0,August,2021,negative,Using same product from outside since an year. This one feels diluted. Flavor still intact but the less freshness feeling.
3.0,September,2021,positive,"It's good for cleaning mouth but if you have gastric problem, better not go for it."
3.0,March,2022,neutral,Personally I like the non alcoholic ones.
3.0,March,2018,negative,"If you use this product without diluting it with water, it will cause a burning sensation in your mouth and you wouldn't be able to keep gargle as much as you would want to.  If you dilute it with water, it kind of loses its effectiveness. Although this sensation aspect is a little subjective but frankly this product didn't suit me. There  are better non-burning solutions in the market such as colgate plax that are equally effective. I would recommend going for those."
3.0,April,2018,negative,"Seller: CloudtailPrinted MRP: Rs. 115/- per 250ml bottlePurchased for: Rs. 213/- (for three 250ml bottles)Mfg. Date: 11/17Exp. Date: 10/20Made in: Bangalore, INI got this because of tooth decay & cavities. Have been using for just a fortnight now. One of the visible effect after using for first few days was reduced gum pain. Will switch over to another variant suitable for cavities after this."

3.0,January,2022,positive,Good
3.0,September,2020,negative,Good deal price but I personally prefer the LISTERENE ORIGINAL flavour as it gives the real feel of using a mouthwash. The mint flavour has too much of sweetness which I didn't like much!
3.0,August,2021,negative,I liked this product but the longevity itâ€™s not good
2.0,June,2022,positive,I have been using Listerine mouth wash for years. thought i was getting a good deal here but the product seems a bit off. It tastes different.
3.0,January,2021,positive,"I preferred the original. I will buy that the next time. Also, this 500 ml bottle is too big for normal bathroom use."
3.0,May,2021,neutral,I don't no what extend it wil clean but when ever we use eyes get wateryðŸ˜­
3.0,January,2020,negative,"Order was placed for two packs of 500ml Listerine, each pack containing two 500ml bottles. But the delivered package contained one pack of two 500ml bottles and the other pack had only two 250ml bottles. Atrocious!!!"
3.0,June,2021,neutral,Not difference before use and after use

3.0,March,2020,negative,go for colgate if u want mild taste
3.0,December,2017,negative,"I donâ€™t like it, it burns for 30 sec when itâ€™s in my mouth, if you daily use you will get habituated  and the taste of this product is average. What I like about it is. It gives refreshing affect inside my mouth for few hours."
3.0,January,2021,positive,Like
2.0,December,2021,negative,I dislike it. It cuts the tongue and whole mouth.
3.0,October,2019,negative,Too stingy and I don't think you should use it without diluting it
3.0,July,2020,negative,It irritates a lot
2.0,February,2021,negative,I used the original flavour before and it does not develop so much froth while gargling. The flavour of this one is ok but why so much shampoo effect while gargling? It doesnâ€™t help as things pour out due to extra foaming effect. Too much sorbitol :(
3.0,August,2019,negative,It tastes more diluted than what youâ€™d get from a shop
2.0,August,2021,negative,It burns in my mouth special on my taste buds i don't know is it normal or this product causing damage to my toung

3.0,February,2019,positive,The after-use feeling is good. I haven't seen any long term difference though. I wonder if it's needed at all.
3.0,May,2019,positive,Its good but Original mouthwash of Lister is way more better then this....
1.0,December,2020,positive,"The listerine we purchased from amazon, was not having strong cleaning power, during gargle. we have been using yellow bottle and this yellow bottle has very powerful cleaning power and flavor as well longevity. I usually bought from medical stores, but the blue bottle I purchased from amazon was not satisfactory and therefor I will never buy it again from amazon, other things I bought I am very happy with the same."
3.0,August,2018,positive,It's is really good but it is not soothing me I guess because I am getting mouth ulcers by using it  it's really hard .
