1.0,February,2018,negative,"Order was placed for three bottles of 250ml under a scheme which was offering 750ml at price of 500ml bottle. However, Instead of delivering three bottles of 250ml one bottle of 500ml was delivered at MRP. It is clear case of cheating i.e. promising to sell under a especial scheme there after backing out of it. Sum involved was small ,hence did not take up the matter immediately"
