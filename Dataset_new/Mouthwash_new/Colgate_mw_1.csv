2.0,October,2023,positive,Costly
1.0,December,2023,negative,Too costly and burns mouth
3.0,July,2022,positive,"Cool clove is better than Fresh mint. Instead of purchasing pack of 3, first purchase just 1 to see whether you are comfortable with it or not."
3.0,June,2021,negative,"I don't know why companies feel the need to add so much menthol or whatever it is that tingles and burns in mouthwash and toothpaste. It says ""Doesn't burn"" but it does. I've used Listerine in the past and that was horrible. This is much better but not ideal. It's still uncomfortable for me, burns my inner cheeks a bit and I can't wait for the 30 seconds to get over.Won't be repurchasing!!"
1.0,October,2023,negative,I don't know how are people even giving it good reviews. I couldn't believe Colgate would put out a product so bad. The bitter aftertaste was just horrendous.
3.0,December,2022,positive,A
2.0,January,2023,negative,The freshness as others have said is not that good on top of that it leaves a very bitter taste in your mouth which doesn't go away even after gargling a few times. It's just better to go with Listerine in my opinion
3.0,July,2021,neutral,"1. Not as strong as listrien, that doesn‚Äôt mean I am saying to buy listrien.2. Mild and doesn‚Äôt feel much difference.3. I changed from listrien to this because of some offer but again switching back to listrien."
3.0,October,2022,positive,Hi
3.0,November,2020,neutral,"Only thing I didn't like about it at first was It's sweet taste.  Tastes better after dilution with water.It's alcohol free, no burning sensation. Freshness and after taste for 1-2hr.Have been using it for few months now twice a day and still almost half of bottle is remaining."
3.0,June,2021,negative,"I bought this since it is alcohol-free. But I didn't like the taste much. Listerine tastes better but has alcohol. Also, this got done very fast. I will probably not purchase this again."
3.0,November,2021,negative,Flavourful mouthwash but the label says freshness lasts 10 times longer which is a big fat lie.

2.0,March,2021,negative,"Taste so bad, ab 3 pack le lia h use to krna pdega. Don‚Äôt take 3 pack take 1 and if it suits you then take 3 or 10 pack whichever you want. But personally I didn‚Äôt liked it at all."

3.0,March,2020,negative,An okay product taste not that great
3.0,October,2018,positive,Get the Peppermint Splash over this. Much better flavor. This one is not too minty. I prefer mine ice cold!
1.0,August,2022,negative,I developed mouth ulcers after using it for 5-6 days. And got bleeding. They must be using alcohol in it which I think damaged my cheek tisssues from within. Don't use this. Use homemade product. I regret buying it.
1.0,March,2022,negative,Colgate Max Plax is worst mouthwash ever as it contains Cetylpyridinium chloride which causes brown stains on your teeth. Don't ever buy it. I have experienced brown staining of my teeth due to this mouthwash. Several dentists also advised me against using this specific mouthwash.
1.0,March,2023,neutral,Not the value product loss of money
3.0,September,2017,neutral,"This product has no class in comparison to it's international version. Disappointed. Doesn't create that clean taste in the mouth, nor does the aftertaste last very long. Will not prevent bad breath."

1.0,September,2019,negative,"Well really disappointed.I ordered for the peppermint flavor, and i got the green tea one.And as far as the green tea one goes, which i had used previously, it is not your type, if you dont like tea stains in your mouth and oral cavity. You guys better stay away from the green tea flavour.Others go for it."
3.0,July,2016,positive,Good enough. Not as strong as listerine.It says no alcohol or whatever.But does the job like it should. Taste is quite ok too.

1.0,May,2022,positive,Avoid using it.
2.0,May,2017,negative,Nasty aftertaste that absolutely refuses to leave. Colgate doesn't sting the way Listerine does. But I'd take Listerine over this any day. This is a product review.I'd give it 1 star were it not for Amazon's fabulous delivery.
