3.0,November,2021,positive,"The main thing is you should ideally dilute it - 3 parts liquid, 1 part water. It really stings if you use it as is, my eyes kinda wateredðŸ˜…I am ok with it diluted, its fresh (not minty) and kinda sweet but I feel like the sweetness lingers more which I don't like much. Now I have got used to the sting and sweetness, so I kinda like it, and have used more than half of it.As a mouthwash, it's pretty good. I don't know the cavity fighter claims, but keeps mouth fresh and clean.Although the bottle is big, it's sturdy and portable, which is quite useful"
