3.0,September,2022,positive,"Everything good except that it feels soapy and forms a lot of foam, also its a bit rough for the mouth.Go with the 'Cool Mint' or 'Cavity fighter' ones."
1.0,December,2023,negative,I had to stop using it coz it hurt my gums. My dentist stopped my usage.
3.0,January,2023,positive,Good
1.0,December,2023,positive,
1.0,July,2023,negative,Listerine Total Care (Purple) most certainly tastes and acts like gargling with salt water.Would you rather pay Rs. 300+ or use a cup of water with a teaspoon of salt when both of them will give you the same outcome? Do as your pocket allows you to.This is a gimmic concept that people blindly fall for - Pushing basic & inexpensive-to-produce items that our grandparents used with a ridiculous premium charged by conglomerates in the name of modernism.
1.0,October,2023,negative,The material in the bottle seems dialuted
1.0,September,2022,negative,It is mild but the after taste sucks
3.0,March,2023,positive,"I really liked the product. Best taste, no strong aftertaste like the other variants, super effective but probably due to the strong characteristics of the product it makes my mouth dry which was not a problem until I noticed my tongue turning black after 15 days of use. I asked my dentist and she told me that its due to dead skin buildup on my tongue due to excessive dryness after using this mouthwash. Stopped using it and it went back to normal within 2-3 days."
