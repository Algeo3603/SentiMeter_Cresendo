2.0,June,2023,negative,"Price is samebas MRP... But quality is not as good as before...!! Without any pressure, just by normal flossing, the threads became multi-strands... Even those thin strands getting stucked between teeth... üòëüòëüò§üò§"
1.0,August,2023,negative,Regretfully I bought a bunch of these. The floss is wire thin and stiff like fishing wire. If not careful it'll chew your gums to bits. I'll find other uses for it but I don't like it as floss.
1.0,September,2023,negative,The floss is very thin and it is coming as pieces and they are stucking in between teeth.
1.0,August,2023,positive,One year old stock
3.0,February,2020,negative,"Oral B floss doesn‚Äôt require any review. It‚Äôs undoubtably the best. The only strange thing was what I received here. None of the three packs had any mandatory stamps of expiry/manufacturing, date of import etc as evident in the attached photos. The plastic spool, however, had the usual stamping. Don‚Äôt know if I got an original product."
1.0,June,2023,negative,I just noticed that the dental floss i bought had expired in 2019 I want other potential buyers to be careful & not buy this
1.0,May,2022,negative,"Product is imported from Ireland and supposed to be high quality. It mentioned that the dental floss does not fray - get worn out. But this Oral B dental floss is horrible. I used to use Colgate floss which was far better, but Oral B we cannot even use it once to clean. The floss disintegrates in your mouth and you are left with very thin plastic strands stuck to your teeth. My intestines must be full of this plastic by now. PATHETIC BRAND!!!"
3.0,July,2021,positive,Barely satisfied with the quality!
3.0,March,2021,positive,Easy to use
1.0,March,2022,negative,Don't buy it. Don't justify the quality compair to its price.
2.0,June,2020,negative,How meany length of thread
1.0,June,2022,positive,I only received two out of three.
1.0,June,2021,positive,The quality is crap
1.0,October,2023,negative,"My last Oral B Mint floss lasted me a whole year, where as this floss keeps on disintegrating, either it tears or gets jumbled up, I have no idea how did they ruin something that was so perfect."
1.0,January,2020,negative,"Most hopeless floss, very rough and poorly waxed.. Harmful for the enamel"
1.0,August,2020,positive,Have received an expired product
3.0,September,2021,positive,It is a pack of three each priced at MRP Rs110. Can get easily from a nearby store. How do they mentioned it price at Rs765. I got it for 395 which is more than MRP.
,February,2024,positive,Temps de livraison trop long.
,June,2023,positive,Malgr√© que ce produit soit d'une belle marque et qu'il sent bon √† la menthe je trouve que le fil est un peu fin
,October,2023,negative,Durch die d√ºnne Zahnseide  entstehen oft Verletzungen am Zahnfleisch. Hatte vorher welche v. Edeka Mark. Etwas teurer aber auch dicker. Diese reinigte  die Zahnzwischenr√§ume besser .beim n√§chsten Einkauf kaufe ich mir andere Zahnseide.
,on,17,negative,I was unable to buy the floss from local chemist so was pleased to receive order within a couple of days - well priced
,on,7,positive,"This is a review of Amazon, not of the floss.  The floss is excellent, my preferred brand and style.  HOWEVER, the Amazon carrier (probably a local Door Dash driver or something) left it at a neighbor's house (a vacant house for sale), not mine.  I finally received it three months later when the owner found the package in her garage.  The same happened to another package that went to a different neighbor's house, but we tracked it more closely since it was critical.  If I can find a place to review Amazon I will put this review there.  Meanwhile, I am trying to shop any place else besides Amazon."
,March,2023,negative,The package was not fullThere should be 3 flossBut there was only 2
,September,2023,negative,Contrairement √† ce qui est annonc√© ces fils dentaires ne sont ni cir√©s ni menthol√©s et sont de tr√®s mauvaise qualit√©.
,on,10,positive,"This was actually painful for me, but my wife thought it was OK.  It would be good for people with very tight spacing between teeth, but not mine.  Felt like elastic fishing line."
,on,9,positive,It‚Äôs ok but a lot thinner than the other oral b floss I have bought so not as effective
,April,2016,negative,"Le produit en lui m√™me est pas mal , sauf qu'il s'abime trop rapidement , le temps de livraison est tr√®ssss long , le go√ªt est pas mal m√™me si trop peu √† mon go√ªt , vous recevrez 3 rouleaux , sinon voil√† c'est pas mal , mais je le trouve peu utile ."
,on,14,negative,Floss falls into container having to reopen and line up
,May,2014,negative,"Le fait qu'il soir cir√© et menthol√© est agr√©able, le fil ne blesse pas, il remplit bien sa fonction mais il n'est pas facile √† tenir car il est vraiment cir√©..."
,on,18,negative,"Very bad quality, It tears off when you‚Äôre trying to use it will not buy it ever again"
,February,2012,negative,"Je suis tr√®s d√©√ßu par ce produit. S'effiloche au moindre accro et devient coupant, de plus la cire qui enduit le fil ne tient pas correctement. Direct √† la poubelle, les fils dentaires en t√©flon de supermarch√© sont nettement sup√©rieurs."
,February,2014,neutral,Le produit re√ßu ne correspond pas √† la photo... vous recevrez des fils dans une petite bo√Æte et non un fil de 50m dans un d√©rouleur en plastique!
