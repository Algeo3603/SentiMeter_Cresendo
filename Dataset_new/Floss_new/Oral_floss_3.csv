3.0,January,2024,positive,Standard good quality unflavoured floss but it‚Äôs too expensive on Amazon.
3.0,January,2024,positive,Need more strength in the string . It‚Äôs easily breaking
3.0,December,2023,negative,"Mint flavor. But the thread gets split after flossing half of my teeth, as if its not strong enough."
2.0,February,2024,negative,This product it tears away after just flossing you start... all the fiber or threads become open.. i suggest Colgate one which have used for more more than 1yr. Much better than oral b
2.0,January,2024,negative,Better than the new released colgate floss but not the best as it frays in tight contact teeth . But colgate has ruined it's quality so this was the better choice . Can do better if the company increases it's quality .
2.0,December,2023,negative,"Don't buy unless you want to pay extra Rs 150 import charges. This is imported from UK and hence the price. Buy the Colgate one, it's the same I've used both. This just have the mint flavour in the floss. Does the same job."
3.0,October,2023,positive,Good üëç
3.0,June,2023,positive,Product is imported so the quality is nice. The box as well as the floss smells like mint. Does the job well
3.0,July,2023,positive,I like it
2.0,September,2023,negative,"Product seems old, the toothpaste kind of coating dried and formed balls in the floss and tastws weird . I am not sure if its just my product."
2.0,September,2023,positive,"It is good to use, however, it expensive more than market price."
1.0,December,2023,negative,Thread is quite thin and breaks vertically so part of it is stuck between the teeth and it's annoying
3.0,February,2023,neutral,Not up to the mark
3.0,September,2021,negative,I have been using Oral-B floss for past 4-5 years. Of course the buying through different media. Also I have bought couple of times from Amazon in past but May be from different seller.But this particular product has wax crystallisation problem. The coated wax on thread comes out while pulling out the thread from the box.
2.0,February,2023,negative,Pathetic product by oral-B.The thread easily breaks while cleaning the teeth and many times the thread particles got stuck in between two teeths.... I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy this.. instead use dental floss with plastic handle .. Never go for a thread
1.0,December,2023,negative,Shredding and sticking in teeth.. ironically..
3.0,July,2022,neutral,The strings come out after flossing for a while. This didn't happen in the Pro version of oral b floss. But it's still pricey
2.0,May,2023,positive,The flavor is good but the quality of thread is poor...
1.0,June,2023,negative,The thread easily breaks into fibres as soon as you use it. It hurtsin your gums to use it.A lot of it is wasted in wrapping it around your fingers because the thread is slippery. A waste of money. Not a value for money product. Increase your budget and get a better product with stronger thread and better grip.
2.0,April,2023,positive,Breaks in fine threads
1.0,October,2023,negative,Terrible. Floss quality is so bad it breaks.
3.0,July,2022,negative,Price is huge but the purpose doesn't solve
2.0,January,2023,negative,It tears into minute thread lines on use. I found the colgate floss to be of higher quality. Won't order this again
3.0,April,2021,negative,The product is satisfactory but the price is way too expensive...I think it's manipulated price it shouldn't cost more than 200‚Çπ( including taxes).Amazon listing says it's made in India but seller claimed it to be imported from UK...strange.
1.0,October,2023,negative,Thread quality is bad its becoming pieces
2.0,January,2023,negative,I like the smell but the sturdiness of floss is very poor. It just keeps breaking while using.
3.0,May,2021,neutral,I got the product with no part of the floss outside the opening. Had to open the case and get the floss out.
1.0,July,2023,negative,"I wouldn't recommend, it tears really easily and gets stuck"
3.0,March,2021,positive,Easy to use.
1.0,December,2021,positive,"Its threads come out and it breaks during usage.Not recommended esp. if you have rough tooth fillings.Only good thing is the mint freshness.You may find it OK if your teeth are even.Else, colgate floss is perfect except that it is not flavoured."
1.0,March,2023,negative,It started breaking everywhere after few days.
1.0,June,2022,positive,Very thick floss colgate has better floss preferably i wil not buy again go for colgate floss
1.0,August,2021,negative,"The floss is getting split into multiple layers after trying to use it. It is not advisable to purchase this as,if the floss remnants remains in between teeth it is not healthy"
1.0,March,2022,negative,Bad product. Breaks soo often. Colgate floss for 75 rs is far better than this.
1.0,July,2021,negative,"This is the worst quality floss I‚Äôve ever used. Everytime u use it, the thread disintegrates and gets stuck b/w the teeth . It is an absolute disappointment."
1.0,October,2019,negative,The wax comes off and sticks to the mouth. Also the twine is delicate. The strands from the floss comes sticks in between the teeth and chokes everytime I tried to use it. I am fortunate I got a full refund from Amazon.
1.0,July,2022,negative,Not good
1.0,July,2020,neutral,I cannot use this as the thread isn't out and there is no way to pull it without opening the container. I believe seller is selling defective item in India
1.0,August,2020,negative,I have problems with my molar teeth and with this item you can‚Äôt reach to clean it. There is no mint flavour in it. Total waste of money.
3.0,June,2023,negative,"The floss thread is too thin and sharp. If you are not careful, it can hurt your gums. I liked the Colgate brand dental floss so much better."
1.0,July,2022,positive,
1.0,March,2021,negative,Product damaged. The floss is stick inside the box and no way to pull it up.
1.0,October,2021,negative,Not worth the money.. very poor quality
1.0,July,2021,positive,Too expensive on Amazon
1.0,June,2021,neutral,Not that sturdy at all...
1.0,August,2021,negative,Not good
1.0,February,2020,negative,Waste of money totally ...It is without wax ...It is just a ‡§ß‡§æ‡§ó‡§æ‡•§‡•§‡•§it is not capable of clean teeth....Useless....
1.0,March,2023,negative,"This is a really really cheap quality and dangerous product by Oral-B. It 'could' have been good with all that mint smell while flossing, but trust me, do NOT buy it even if someone gives it for free. It is so cheap that it disintegrates into multiple very very thin microstrands in your mouth while flossing, which you will end up digesting! If you don't want to eat all that plastic, don't buy this. Colgate Floss is a great alternative which is not 'mint smell', but at least does the job without making you eat plastic."
,December,2018,positive,"looks like 10 years old in stock,,,,,"
,September,2021,positive,Le fil est trop fin pour moi. Solide et parfum√© il reste efficace.
,November,2020,negative,"La calidad es la que es, no hay m√°s. Durante su uso se me ha deshilachado. El sabor a menta es lo que se espera. Dado su precio, tampoco se le puede pedir mas."
,on,8,negative,"The floss flakes apart, leaving white specs to snowflake down over your counter. But, it's cheap and does its job."
,October,2020,negative,"Il filo di per s√© √® ottimo. Lo avevo acquistato al supermercato ed era il mio preferito. Nello specifico per√≤, quello che mi √® arrivato a casa fa una cosa strana: quando lo ""giro"" tra le mani per bloccarlo, inizia a perdere ""pallini""..come se lo strato di menta si sgretolasse e mi ritrovo con pallini in mano ed in bocca. Non so a cosa sia dovuto.. Se forse l'articolo in questione non √® originale,o forse solo l'unit√† che mi √® arrivata era ""danneggiata"".. non saprei. Dopo qualche giorno mi √® comparsa un'infezione alla bocca.. Potrebbe non essere assolutamente collegata al filo, ma per correttezza preferisco scriverlo"
,on,24,positive,"Floss is floss - it does the job and tastes nice. The flavouring is good, but it seems to flake. My floss flakes all over me when I use it - I think that is just the flavouring though. Could be better"
,on,30,negative,You cannot access the floss without breaking the box! Do not order from here- faulty item.
,on,18,positive,Just buying here because it's convenient
,on,18,negative,Both faulty...comes out shredded and or like tape...do not buy
,on,17,positive,"Good dental floss however in the product description it said the texture of the floss is shred resistant, it isn't shred resistant. But still good value for money and I would still recommend for the price."
,on,11,positive,Title.
,on,19,positive,Received 3 days late hence low rating. Product itself is fine.
,on,23,negative,I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs supposed to have such a strange flavour
,on,15,negative,Decent floss does shred quite easily and this one hurts your gums a bit more than the satin one. The satin one hurts less and doesn't shred at all. I wouldn't recommend you buy this one or the satin one from Amazon. Your local chemist probably has it for cheaper.
,October,2020,positive,"Filo interdentale molto economico rispetto a quanto si spende al supermercato per lo stesso, √® buono ma si sfilaccia molto presto... Comunque certamente √® usabile e a questo prezzo va bene.Magari solo non √® semplicissimo il sistema per tagliarlo"
,on,17,positive,Perfectly every day item at a perfectly everyday price!Just as you'd get at a shop but with the convenience that Amazon brings.
,August,2020,negative,"E' un filo interdentale come tanti altri, forse leggermente un p√≤ troppo spesso. Il vantaggio √® che qui su amazon forse il prezzo √® leggermente inferiore. Tuttavia ho avuto vari problemi con la consegna che √® stata effettuata in ritardo."
,on,22,positive,I can get more at my dollar store for one pound.L
,on,8,negative,"I didn't buy this for it's purpose so my rating does not reflect how good it is for teeth.I bought it as a tool to thread beads onto loom bands. As this is waxed it is rather difficult to do, so I wouldn't recommend this to anyone wanting to purchase for the same reason as me."
,on,11,positive,It's ok. Has a mild minty flavour just frays alot while using
,on,13,negative,Feels a little weak and easily breaks. Could be im too rough but i feel like other brands have a stronger floss.
,on,11,negative,"I did not get on well with this floss compared to my usual brand. It is much more rigid, which probably makes it stronger, but I found that using it after just a couple of days cut the corners of my mouth. Too sharp for me! It did clean between my teeth ok but I will be going for a softer and wider variety next time."
,August,2020,positive,Marca ottimaprodotto anche molto utile per i denti dopo i pasti.solo chd odore non mi e piaciuto e  il prezzo e un po alto
,May,2018,negative,"Le fil est un peu fragile, se casse tr√®s facilement mais √† part √ßa il fait son job et laisse une odeur agr√©able avec son parfum menthe.C'est tr√®s important d'apr√®s mon dentiste d'utiliser du fil dentaire 2 fois par jour min afin d'avoir des dents en bonne sant√© sans tartre et bact√©ries"
,August,2020,negative,√à al mentolo cosa che non c‚Äô√® scritta. √à molto spesso rispetto ai normali fili interdentali.Si spezza con gran facilit√†.Spedizione Amazon veloce
,on,22,positive,Works fine but annoying to use as the floss tends to split
,on,7,negative,I have bought these for a few months now but for the past 2 months I can smell a mouldy damp smell frm them like they've got damp at some point or kept in a room with mould.I have now stopped my subscription for this item.
,February,2021,negative,"se rompe f√°cil, y demasiado grueso seg√∫n mi parecer"
,May,2021,positive,Pensavo pi√π pratico
,on,30,negative,The quality isn't as good as store bought ones; almost as if it skipped some quality checks. The floss was stuck at first and I had to open up the casing to fix but it is still usable.
,on,29,negative,I find it a bit too thin and smooth which means it doesnt remove the food and plaque as well as other brands
,on,1,positive,"its long ,strong and a good price however it dose not really grip onto any food stuff so even after flossing the same gap food still remains, thinking maybe a tape floss would be better ."
,on,15,negative,"I always struggle to open this package.Not the cardboard but the actual plastic which holds the floss.If you do it very gently it will open (sometimes)If you get frustrated and put more force into it, you will break your fingers trying to pry it open."
,February,2020,positive,Sapore alla menta che lascia una freschezza molto gradevole in bocca. Filo resistente e di una lunghezza che dura per abbastanza tempo.
,on,4,positive,It does the job
,December,2020,positive,Bien
,on,5,negative,Pretty bad
,on,10,negative,"Don‚Äôt buy this it‚Äôs thinner than cotton, impossible to use. Despite its thinness it splits. Gets stuck in your teeth. I‚Äôve thrown it in the bin."
,January,2021,negative,"Questo filo interdentale √® troppo aggressivo per le mie gengive sensibili. Inoltre non pulisce come si deve. L‚Äôultra floss era eccezionale, non capisco perch√© non venga pi√π prodotto. Un vero peccato"
,on,16,negative,Flimsy and poor quality. Better off buying my floss from local supermarkets. Dispenser jammed and the floss kept breaking in my teeth. Would not recommend
,July,2020,negative,Lo acquisto da tempo e sempre soddisfatto.A questo giro packaging danneggiato ed essendo una cosa che poi metto in bocca non mi ha fatto molto piacere.
,on,1,negative,Normally order floss from my local supermarket. When I received the product it was poor quality and the floss is very flimsy and of poor quality. Would recommend buying from your local supermarket or a better version. Like others have said the item is not eligible for a refund so buy elsewhere and avoid this product.
,September,2020,negative,"Il filo √® profumato ed il rapporto qualit√† prezzo √® ottimo, ma rispetto al filo interdentale oral b 3D white luxe, ha una qualit√† pi√π bassa, si sfilaccia subito. Torner√≤ al mio vecchio filo."
,August,2019,negative,"Ottimo prodotto, consegna rapida, peccato che nella descrizione non ci sia scritto che √® un filo al mentolo. Avrei preferito fosse neutro."
,July,2020,negative,Sembra sia vecchio in quanto di sfilaccia facilmente
,on,17,negative,"This floss has a strong smell, a chemical smell, and it's poor quality."
,on,3,positive,ok
,on,13,negative,"This product is poor, the floss comes apart leaving strands in gums and mouth. Won't order this again."
,July,2020,positive,buon prodotto!
,on,14,negative,Snaps often and difficult to use.
,December,2020,negative,Ho aperto l‚Äôinvolucro di plastica e ho trovato il cosino di plastica rotto
,January,2020,negative,"Normale , gusto non molto buono , resistente"
