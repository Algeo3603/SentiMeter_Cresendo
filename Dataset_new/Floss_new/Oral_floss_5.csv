1.0,September,2023,negative,Not easy to use
2.0,February,2019,neutral,It was not upto our expectations.
,August,2019,negative,Lo he recibido muy tarde con el envase hecho polvo y la fecha de caducidad pasada pero al no estar en espa√±ol

,on,22,positive,"Good product, however the page describes this as a pack of 6, but only one was delivered.  Product itself is a 5 star item, marking down to a 3 as the value for money is woeful."
,January,2024,negative,"Zahnseide ist f√ºr mich nicht zu benutzen, da sie sehr stark duftet und dementsprechend auch schmeckt."
,on,10,negative,I ordered these because they used to be the best for cleaning around and under the bridges of my teeth. They are not the same quality as before. The threader end is not as stiff and makes it a little harder to thread under your bridge. The fuzzy part is really not very fuzzy anymore. It is more like the old tape dental floss as far as being a sufficient tool. I am really disappointed in this product.
,December,2023,negative,"Great idea for people with bridges/implants to get into those tight spots. However, I find the supposed reinforced end not so strong. I am used to using the floss threaders, which are more sturdy. With these, it often takes a long time to get it to go between the implant and my gums but with a threader, it goes in easy every time.I also don't like the floss part, as it feels too flimsy and shreds easily."
,on,12,negative,Not really happy of the purchase. I got just one package instead of six I paid for.
,on,16,negative,Didn‚Äôt realize I had ordered mint flavor. This tastes like mint essence with a petroleum finish.  The unflavored ones do not taste like petroleum.
,on,2,negative,"Little hard to use,way to long,and hard to get between bridge."
,February,2024,negative,Vor einigen Jahren hat es sich gelohnt die teuren Floss von OralB zu kaufen. Heute nicht mehr.Der Flo√ü ist viel d√ºnner geworden als fr√ºher. Der verst√§rkte Faden an der Seite ist auch nicht mehr shr steif.Die Verpackung und die Entnahmen l√§√üt auch zu w√ºnschen √ºbrig.
,October,2023,negative,"Die Zahnseide hat zu wenig ""flausch"" also nutzbaren Bereich in der Mitte. Zudem wird die Zahnseide, wenn man sie mit √∂rtlichen Drogerien vergleicht, viel zu teuer verkauft (was mir leider erst hinterher aufgefallen ist). Zum Schlu√ü sei noch gesagt, dass es eher was f√ºr die gro√üen Zahnzwischenr√§ume ist."
,on,13,neutral,"Purchased to floss under my bridge but the floss is thick and doesn't slide well, uncomfortable."
,on,26,negative,"It's not the same as the ones I got from the dentist's office, and it's not easy to use."
,on,28,neutral,Have used these for a long time to get under bridge. They seem thinner and certainly not as smooth. Don‚Äôt work as well as they used to.üò¢Guess it‚Äôs like everything else today less is cheaper to make.
,on,23,negative,"This was recommended by my periodontist, but I found it didn't work well for me. I've been having oral surgery and wearing splinted temporary crowns. Regular floss can't be used with splints, so the idea was to thread the super floss through the space at the gum line. The floss has three distinct textures: a hard end, like the aglet on a shoelace, only thinner; a crisp length, for scraping; and a soft length, like the floss everyone knows best. The crisp length wound up cutting my gums where I had stitches, and I wasn't able to continue using it."
,on,29,negative,I purchased these to floss under a permanent bonded retainer. These are such poor quality. If I could rate w/ negative stars then I would. These are so thin and flimsy. Picture of what the floss did when I pushed it through 2 teeth. It wouldn‚Äôt even go through.
,on,11,negative,"I do not recommend this product. The most annoying aspect is that the floss shreds as you use it and gets stuck in your teeth.  The product is shown having two sides to thread, but really only has one side to thread.  The threader only works if you have a large space for it to thread into.  If the space is small, the threader bends and does not go through.  I like the concept of a floss threader, but the needle needs to be stronger/thicker and the floss stronger so it doesn‚Äôt shred."
,on,18,negative,These do NOT work for dental bridges. You need floss with a more rigid end to get through the bridge near the gum and this is not the right tool for it. Do not waste your money.
,on,18,negative,The thread part is constantly getting stuck in my braces and then I have to use tweezers to pull that out. Not with it to ms
,August,2022,negative,"I have used this super floss for so many years and it had been an excellent tool to clean around by dental bridgework. Something has changed in the manufacture and the quality is rather inferior. The stiffened section designed to thread easily under bridgework or braces is now too soft and floppy and difficult to push through smaller spaces. The fluffy part of the floss, designed to capture more food and plaque is coarser with less grip though. I do not understand why these have changed after so many years of being an invaluable dental hygiene tool. The only answer i can come up to is that the production costs have dropped dramatically to create this inferior product.I will have to look for a different product for this task in future I feel."
,on,18,positive,Don‚Äôt like skinny floss & then fatter floss manufactured together.  Dr Tungs is the best for flossing!
,on,14,negative,Did not receive full order. Only received 2 packs when I paid for 3.
,on,30,negative,product is useless for bridges..there is really no stiff end to floss..also box comes opened...not sealed...does not seem like real oral b product...and no way to return.....gives you link to oral B which says can only be returned if bought from oral B
,on,25,negative,It breaks apart in an instant.You can not return it either
,on,8,negative,"I was hoping this might be an easier to use alternative to floss threaders I have used in the past. Unfortunately, the threading component of these is not nearly rigid enough to fit through tight spaces. To make matters worse, the floss tears much more quickly than even average floss. Altogether, this isn‚Äôt so much super floss as pre-cut sub par floss."
,on,10,negative,"Imbreakable core that can be very painful, coated with expanding floss that breaks loose on first passage and wreaks havoc on braces. I got it to clean under my permanent brace. Ended up spending an hour trying to pull out all the strands with tweezers and with a regular floss. The strands stuck under the braces also resulted in increased pressure on the teeth which was painful...Horrible product! I regret using it a lot more than I care about the waist of money! Avoid at all costs!"
,on,8,neutral,The plastic tip is not thick enough and that makes it hard to use with a bridge.
,on,4,negative,"Don‚Äôt use this if you have any tight teeth/etc. They shred and leave pieces stuck in between. 3 teeth in and it‚Äôs unusable. I first tried these years ago and they did the same thing, no improvement."
,on,21,negative,"I prefer the normal version of this same floss rather than pre-cut product. It has small area for floss and huge dangling normal threats for holding on to. The design is inefficient. So, I won't be purchasing again."
,on,7,negative,The box was torn and open.
,on,16,negative,I won‚Äôt buy again. There is no strong tip to help get under the bridge for what I bought it for. I bought another kind of this brand hoping to get floss with a hard end for bridges.  Again I got packages I cannot use. I will not order this brand again.
,on,12,negative,"Was hoping I could use these for all my teeth but too thin and break easily so only good cor bridge.  However , lead string  is sometimes hard to get between crowns to get started. Also don‚Äôt like the packaging. Won‚Äôt buy again"
,on,21,negative,"I ordered this product for my bridges. It doesn‚Äôt work for my bridges because the1 side that you pull through is not stiff enough to pull through the bridge.Only use is for floss, which is not why I ordered it!Seller will do nothing for you when contacted.Plus they aren‚Äôt wrapped individually, you open the pack & they are all there, not like the ones I used to order that I loved, that were discontinued.It‚Äôs defective, & shouldn‚Äôt be sold to be used for a bridge on Amazon."
,on,9,negative,So disappointed
,on,14,neutral,"First of all, I'm not sure how one would even use these regularly, especially someone who has hand pain or lack of precision in the hands.You stick them under the bridge, and then you have to thread it all the way to the back of your mouth, then dig the end of it out with your fingers before you can floss.  Water pik is way better than trying to do this every day.The way they are packaged makes it almost impossible to just pull one at a time out.  They come out in a tangled mess.I would not recommend these for people with bridges.  And people without bridges can more easily use the floss picks.In other words, I have no idea what these are even for."
,on,1,positive,The product is ok.  I like another brand better. But it wasn‚Äôt available. This one is difficult to get out of the package.
,on,3,negative,"First of all, I called and complained about this product which arrived late in a smashed box with the floss outside of the box and then when I used it the floss started breaking almost immediately.  Maybe this was unusual, but I would not buy again."
,on,4,negative,Product supposedly has stiffened ends that thread through teeth. Ends are too soft to work
,on,12,negative,"Floss is disappointing and I prefer Glide. The plastic coated end of the floss is so flimsy it is difficult to insert between teeth. The floss itself is too thick and not smooth, making it difficult to pull through. The strands are packaged in such a way that they get tangled up with each other. All in all I cannot recommend this product."
,on,27,negative,"Used it for my all on 4 implants, this doesn‚Äôt work or even gets to the most obvious areas- total fail!!"
,November,2022,negative,"In der Anzeige steht ausdr√ºcklich 6St√ºck, aber geliefert wurde nur eine Packung, das ist nicht in Ordnung"
,on,13,neutral,It does not have a slightest resemblance to a teeth floss. You can't even start to slide between the teeth. Buy it if you wanted to sharpen your teeth. Tossed it out.
,March,2023,positive,regular floss is much better.
,June,2019,positive,PRIMA HANDHABUNG.OK
,on,25,negative,"Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, description says pack of 6. 50 strands. So I was expecting six boxes with 50 strands each. I only received one box with 50 strands. Box looks old and a bit dewy too? I thought I got a good deal but I feel like I got cheated."
,February,2021,negative,"Braucht man halt, egal was es kostet"
,June,2020,negative,Die Zahnseide kam v√∂llig zerdr√ºckt bei mir an. Eigentlich hatte ich die Zahnseide mit Floss f√ºr meine Br√ºckenreinigung bestellt. Leider musste ich feststellen das der Flossanteil auf den vorgeschnittenen St√ºcken minimal und viel zu klein ist. Zahnseide habe ich selbst. Ich hatte gedacht das mehr Flossanteil dabei ist. Der Preis und die Qualit√§t stimmen √ºberhaupt nicht.
,on,31,positive,Should have received a pack of 6 but only one pack turned up
,January,2020,negative,Verpackung kam besch√§digt an im Gro√üen und ganz nicht wie erwartet
,on,17,negative,These do not work well for tight spaces. They often got stuck in-between my molars and I had to use a thinner glide floss to get the broken up floss out. It also sometimes took 2-3 pieces to floss my teeth due to the softer part breaking apart.
,December,2019,negative,Ich schlie√üe mich der Bewertung von Iven Twellmeyer vom Mai an. Packung sieht aus wie schon mal gebraucht . Die Zahnseide sieht aus wie nachtr√§glich eingeschwei√üt . Genau wie auf den Fotos von dem genannten Rezensor. W√§re es mir nicht zu bl√∂d w√ºrde ich es zur√ºckschicken . Hier bestelle ich definitiv nicht meh.
,on,18,positive,The description on this was that it was a pack of 6. I ordered a quantity of 2 so was expecting 12 boxes. What was received was 2 boxes! Beware!
,on,7,negative,I was looking for Glide but it was hard to come by. Too harsh on gums and too stringy to remove from bag.
,on,17,negative,"After pulling 1 or 2 strands from the package, the next one became completely entangled with all of the other strands. I tried to fix the issue, but it ended up getting worse. I finally had to throw it out in the trash because it was useless. I couldn't find anywhere to contact the seller."
,on,8,negative,Product arrived promptly but should of been 6 packs of 50 and only received 1 pack of 50 and the package was battered.
,on,9,positive,Should have been a pack of 6 but only 1 arrived
,on,12,negative,"Super thick, not comfortable and it broke my wire. These are so difficult to use for most people with any kind of retainer or braces."
,on,13,negative,Floss coarse...did not slide between teeth well. All strands packaged together...hard to get out.Tossed product
,on,28,negative,"Doesnt say its mint floss on the packaging, but it is"
,on,27,negative,My dentist recommended this as an alternate for dental floss. I bought it in good faith and was sorely disappointed. It frays when it is used as a floss( what it is supposed to be used as). And then one has the problem of how to get all those little hairlike threads from between one's teeth out! A messy and most unpleasant ordeal. A real bummer of a product!
,May,2019,positive,"Das Produkt sieht aus als h√§tte es jemand 1 Monat in der Ges√§√ütasche getragen, nach √ºber 5 Wochenh√§tte ich das besser und preiswerter bei ""budni "" bekommen. F√ºr ein Hygieneprodukt bemerkenswert"
,on,25,neutral,Only contains one pack and isn't mint either.
,on,12,negative,I can‚Äôt use this floss. It is so thick that it hurts to slide between my teeth. So sad this got substituted for my normal delivery.
,on,22,negative,Difficult to use! Need 3-4 to clean all teeth. By that time my fingers hurt. The floss thread is hard to pull.
,on,1,positive,The Oral-B super floss was impossible to insert between some of my bridges.  Apparently the spacing between my  teeth is too narrow.  Now I am using the Crest Glide Threader Floss which works great.  Just hope I can continue to buy the Threader Floss from Crest.
,on,7,negative,I got these cause they were a cheaper alternative to another brand. This floss felt like fabric between my teeth and it was pretty difficult and unpleasant to use.
,on,29,negative,Kept on breaking in my teeth
,on,5,negative,This floss is worthless. Too thin and poorly cut. A waste of time and $.
,on,17,negative,It was broken and seems used! I am so outraged ÔºÅ
,on,13,positive,Thanks
