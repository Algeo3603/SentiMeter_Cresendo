3.0,October,2022,positive,Good product but difficult to use. I feel floss sticke are easier than this thread. As it's expensive I am using it with some difficulty.
3.0,April,2022,negative,"The product was wrapped in a plastic cover, but after removing the cover, it looks like someone opened it and did not even close it again. How could this happen? Must be sealed as a health product."
1.0,July,2023,negative,The thread got stuck inside and it's not rolling out I need to open the floss box every time and use it. It's not worth it for this high price.
2.0,July,2022,positive,
3.0,July,2022,positive,Good floss. Better than the normal super thin flosses but not as good as expandable floss.
,on,6,neutral,"I prefer another version they do. This 1 I bought by accident, its OK but it rolls up and shreds. It is very soft and light so in some ways it's OK but just not to my taste. Although the mintyness is ok too."
,on,13,negative,"May have been the wrong choice for me, but the level of flatness impacted my flossing a bit more than the string options.Otherwise okay"
,on,28,negative,"Lid and cutting device a bit awkward to get the hang of, but once mastered was fine.  Handy being in a bigger size."
,on,22,neutral,"This isn't like the floss I had before. It's rather weird. I didn't know if I was supposed to clean my teeth with it or use to correct something I'd written on a piece of paper. The minty taste is nothing more than a concept. I mean, it didn't break. It did stick to my fingers when I tried to drop it in the bin. Preferred the old stuff."
,on,10,negative,The container for the floss broke very quickly after little use
,January,2024,positive,"Il prodotto di per sé è buono ma per due volte mi è arrivato il filo lungo solo 25 metri (scritto sulla confezione)mentre nella descrizione c’è scritto 40, ho segnalato il problema ma nel nuovo ordine mi è arrivato lo stesso (25 metri)."
,on,11,positive,
,on,13,neutral,"I know it's just floss but I don't expect to get something out of date via Amazon. Printed date is 07/23 and I ordered in 12/23.Additionally just for anyone who cares between the difference this is technical dental tape, the thicker stuff, not pin-thin dental floss.If you don't mind the above two issues this is fine and I will use it, but it's not what I was expecting from the description."
,November,2023,negative,"Aufgrund einer Empfehlung meines Zahnarztes habe ich die Oral B Pro Expert Premium Zahnseide gesucht. Ich habe diesen Artikel bestellt und gedacht das richtige Produkt gefunden zu haben. Es wurden 25 m Clinic Line Zahnseide geliefert, statt 40 m Premium. Ich habe danach googelt und keinen Treffer zu dieser Produktserie gedunden.Desweiteren ist der Aufdruck auf dem eigentlichen Behälter etwas verschwommen, was beim Produkt im Zahnarztzimmer nicht der Fall war. Beim Logo auf dem Behälter und auf der Papierverpackung fehlt das R.Das finde ich seltsam, auch wenn ein Produktionsdatum =4/22 und die Nummer (seriennummer?) 2098652650 drauf gedruckt sind.Im Übrigen fasert die Zahnseide."
,on,27,negative,Can't say how good our not the actual product is as the packaging was already broken on arrival and the product was out of date by six months.
,on,23,positive,"The floss itself is really good - pleasant taste, not sharp feeling if it hits your gum. The dispenser is fiddly and awkward though. The tape kept slipping off the reel and jamming it up. When I opened up the case it was really fiddly to sort out. This has never been a problem with other brands. It doesn't seem like it should be rocket science to make a reel that doesn't jam up."
,on,27,positive,Out of date product being sold 4 months over sell by date
,on,10,negative,"This ""floss"" is more like a tape than I'm used to, also the container it's in is rubbish and just falls apart everytime you pull the floss though."
,on,8,negative,"Delivered without its original packaging, don’t know if it’s already been used. Do not recommend"
,on,25,negative,Unsealed product packaging and out of date
,on,10,negative,"Thought we would try Oral B instead of Glide, which we normally have. We must say that we were not really impressed at all with it. The container the floss comes in is not so robust as the Glide and the floss is mounted on the opposite side to the Glide and these two things together, we felt, made things frustrating to pull the Oral B from its dispenser. The floss itself seemed fine it was just the dispensing container that wasn't up to the job. So we won't be ordering again and will stick to Glide."
,on,20,positive,Ordered this in December 2023 and it's out of date.
,on,13,negative,Unfortunately I had to throw the floss away as the packaging had been opened. I wasn't comfortable putting something in my mouth thats been tampered with
,on,4,negative,I've been attaching the flosser to a reusable floss handle.  It's a very weak floss line.  I probably get about two goes over my teeth before the line breaks.  Quite poor considering the price.  Can barely taste the mint or whatever flavour it's supposed to be. Overpriced and poor quality floss line.
,on,8,positive,Went out of date in July 2023. It's now Dec 2023.
,on,22,negative,"I was really surprised how poor the plastic container is for an Oral-B product until I took the floss reel out and fixed it back in, the floss doesn’t pull out easily and the container just falls apart, hence taking the floss off it’s peg inside helped it pull much better but the container is still loose, hence my 3 stars."
,on,23,positive,
,on,12,negative,"Can't trust an already opened package, threw it straight in the bin."
,November,2023,positive,Filo interdentale che sembra fatto di teflon appiccicoso! Sconsigliato!
,on,25,positive,"It's OK. It's more like a tape, or ribbon kind of thing, instead of a round thread. It's very thin and glides well, but also easy to cut and hurt gums. It cleans, but not as well as really thin round threads. A good thing is that it's very resistant."
,on,2,negative,"Product has a very frail plastic covering. Everytime I try to pull floss for use, the thread is stuck and the cover opens up. Overall, happy with the floss thread but extremely unhappy with the outer covering. It's really frustrating."
,September,2023,negative,La descrizione dice che l'articolo in vendita è 40 metri ma realmente è da 25 metri avendone acquistati 2 ne mancano 30 metri
,on,21,positive,"I love the taste, I love the smell, I love that it's a bit thicker than usual floss and seems to get more out from between teeth. I don't like that the floss rips apart every other time I put it between my teeth, it makes flossing take twice as long as it normally would, and I get through three times the amount of floss I normally would. I won't buy this floss again because the constant ripping in half makes it frustrating to use."
,on,11,negative,Bought this as an alternative to the Oral B satin tape - it's okay. The taste is fine but the texture is very rubbery.
,on,4,positive,"It does a good job and tastes nice, but the pack/box is really flimsy and the floss keeps sliding down the side. You then need to open it up and find the end of the floss again - pretty annoying!"
,on,23,positive,"Its ok, has a nice minty smell. Sometimes the string slips out of my fingers and can be hard to to use on the further away teeth."
,on,18,neutral,"sorry, I don't like this kind of material of Dental Floss, it cannot clean well. but it is better than the blue one"
,on,28,neutral,"It snaps very easily, doesn’t feel like it is strong enough for the job. Surprised as usually expect better from Oral B. It’s a nice size tape that slides easily between teeth and minty taste very slight"
,July,2022,positive,
,on,6,negative,Get dry after 2 days.Not worth a penny.
,July,2019,negative,"Den Bewertungen zu urteilen, hätte ich mehr erwartet. Die Zahnseide macht die Zahnzwischenräume zwar schön sauber, aber das kann die nornale Oral B Essentialfloss auch. Ebenso der Frischegeschmack ist sehr gut, da er nicht so aufdringlich ist.Soweit wäre alles gut, wenn die Zahnseide nur nicht leicht reissen würde. Dieses ist mir schon mehrmals passiert, gerade wenn man im hinteren Bereich die Zahnseide spannen muss, um dort die Zwischenräume zu säubern. Ich habe ziemlich enge Zahnzschwischenräume.Ich werde sie trotzdem wieder kaufen, da ich für mich keine Alternative in Frage kommt. Die Essentialfloss ribbelt sich gerne auf, dies ist viel nerviger, weil dann u.U. winzig dünne Fäden zwischen den Zähnen verbleiben."
,on,6,negative,I’ve used this product for a long time but from the outset this one was stiff to pull the floss through and completely fell apart. Still useable but it’s annoying having to pull floss through twice a day.
,on,12,positive,"The packaging of the product has already been opened, this product is hygienic and its packaging must be correct"
,on,27,negative,"I thought using oral B it would be a safe bet, but it just snaps when using it. Not impressed and won't buy again."
,April,2021,negative,il filo è resistente e il meccanismo di strappo è abbastanza comodo. Però dopo pochi usi l'involucro si è deformato e risulta complicato strappare il filo. Forse il costo è eccessivo per la qualità generale del prodotto (anche se il filo è abbastanza buono).
,on,21,negative,"This is tape not floss!  I hate tape as it doesn't clean between teeth as well so I avoid it wherever possible, but the pack says ""floss"" and the image looks like floss but it is flat tape.  Also, the package was completely in bits so I can't even be sure of how hygienic it is!!"
,on,23,negative,The floss itself is off poor quality and breaks easily and it's slipped out of the casing so now it's difficult to cut a section off.. wouldn't buy this again.
,on,7,negative,The pack stays open like this. It looks faulty. Very unhygienic and annoying
,September,2021,negative,Ho comprato questo filo interdentale perché non si incastra tra i denti e ha un buon sapore.Ma la confezione arrivata sembrava aperta e  reincollata.Oral b e tutti i produttori  di prodotti per l'igiene personale dovrebbero rivedere le confezioni rendendole ecologiche e garantendone l'integrità con un sigillo di garanzia. Amazon permette il reso di prodotti per l'igiene cosa contrariamente a quanto afferma nella sua politica resi. Dovrebbe invece garantire la sicurezza di questi prodotti.
,on,5,negative,"It took out my crown, and is way too thick to fit between teeth. It gets stuck and has a weird faint mint taste. If you have big gaps in your teeth go for it!"
,on,2,neutral,"Alright, does the job. Not a particular fan of the flavour."
,January,2021,neutral,Il prodotto mi è piaciuto però quello che è arrivato a me non c'è scritto floss e comunque quello che mi è arrivato si trova a prezzi molto più bassi. Io l'avevo comprato perché volevo quello floss
,July,2021,negative,"Il filo è ottimo, peccato per la il contenitore che non permette il fluido scorrimento del filo."
,June,2021,negative,Arrivato in tempi giusti. Il prezzo non male. Essendo un po’ più doppio il filo fa un po’ male nell’ utilizzo. Gusto menta
,May,2021,positive,"per quanto sia efficace e di qualità, penso che abbia un prezzo un po elevato."
,April,2020,negative,"La consegna arrivata il giorno prima del previsto. Il filo ha una forma più larga, ma si infila in maniera delicata tra i denti, anche i più stretti. Bisogna utilizzarlo per un po' di tempo al fine di una buona pulizia, perché il filo è delicato e non molto incisivo."
,December,2019,negative,"Dalla descrizione pensavo fosse simile al dental floss (ritirato dal commercio per sospetti problemi di tossicità), invece sembra quasi di ... teflon. Pertanto tranne il sapore fresco, non rimuove a mia sensazione la placca. Non è abbastanza ""ruvido"" come ci si aspetta da un filo interdentale efficace. Deluso"
,on,24,negative,Not worth the price for something that doesn't really clean between your teeth.  The surface of the floss is too smooth and doesn't remove plaque. Would not recommend.
,on,17,negative,I found the floss ro be too thick. So was painful using on my teeth.
,on,5,positive,I purchased this as I expected good things from oral B. You also got a lot of length for your money.The flavour was nice and minty which is very pleasant to use in the mouth.Unfortunately the floss was quite weak and tore in several places when I was using it.
,March,2022,positive,"Gute Zahnseide, jedoch zu teuer."
,on,24,positive,
,September,2020,positive,Il filo interdentale è buono essendo OralB ma non corrisponde a quello della descrizione e foto. Andrebbe corretto per non trarre in inganno.
,on,10,positive,"You put it in your mouth, grind it between your teeth, and make the old foods come out from between. This one does the bleeding less. That's good, right? Does not come with dancing instructions though. 1 star."
,on,12,positive,Thrown away
,on,25,positive,Difficult to use
,on,1,negative,It was broken when It arrived.
,on,16,negative,Thought this would be the thin floss but is actually tape width.
,February,2020,positive,"Pro: buon sapore, fresco al palato. Contro: struttura piatta che tende a “ tagliare “, soprattutto all’interno delle gengive."
,on,23,negative,The plastic wrapping wad opened and even the plastic cover of the product. very disappointed.
,on,15,negative,"I don’t recommend this product, it breaks in your mouth and it’s too slippery /elasticJust buy same brand, but the blue oneThanks"
,September,2020,positive,"a questo prezzo è meglio di altri, mi aspettavo meglio per la resa"
,on,9,positive,Looks and feel very cheap and definitely not an oral-b product
,on,9,negative,I've just come to learn Oral-B Flosses may contain PFAs that are linked to a whole host of health issues. If this is the case this is incredibly worrying. Please do your research and look for natural alternatives.
,on,2,negative,Item arrived on time and undamaged. But when I went to use the floss the box split in two so now it is useless!!! Not happy!
,on,12,negative,Very disappointing the box broke after the first time I used it making it very difficult to get out and use!
,on,4,negative,The container broke quite quickly so it was difficult to use
,September,2022,positive,"Prodotto ottimo, prezzo esagerato.Ho trovato il prodotto in altri shop a 2,70"
,on,22,negative,"Not as good as the ultra floss, it was difficult to use and didn’t do as good a job as the old stuff, I can’t understand why they have gone for this maybe because u will have to use more strands  to do the same job thereby buying more .  Definitely not recommended."
,on,17,negative,"Doesn't ""floss."" waste of money."
,on,29,negative,It's the first floss that I have ever used that snaps when being used.
,October,2022,negative,J'ai reçu mon colis mais on peut constater qu'il a été ouvert et refermé avec du scotch ce n'est pas normal
,on,4,negative,"The thread doesn't snap it's annoying, apart from that it's fine"
,on,30,negative,This arrived not sealed in the packet so don't really want to use it. Not a good item
,October,2020,positive,
,on,21,negative,"£1.70 per pack on subscription for many months, and suddenly it is £4.74 on subscription when you can buy it £2.85 without subscription or £4.52 for a 2 pack? GET YOUR PRICING STRUCTURE RIGHT. It's meant to be cheaper than the stand alone price!!"
,on,11,negative,Not recommended.
,on,25,negative,This product is NOT FLOSS IT IS TAPE. Huge difference and should state this
,on,16,negative,Does as expected and was cheaper.
,October,2019,positive,SolideIndoloreTexture sympa mais je n’aime pas le goût trop fort
,on,6,positive,It tends to fray and shred too easily but it is much better than some SOB ones.
,on,18,positive,This is OK. I thought I was getting floss but it is tape.
,October,2020,negative,"Me gusto el grosor aún que podría ser un poco más grueso, pero la cajita se ha desmontado toda, faltó más calidad en la caja del hilo, no me gustó este aspectos"
,April,2022,negative,"Muy caro! Para me no es profesional, es muy suave y para me no limpia las dientes como describa, no voy a volver a compra"
,on,12,negative,"It makes my tongue burn. A very burning sensation, like pins and needles at the tip my tongue. Only got it because it was 40m. Would not recommend at all."
,on,26,negative,It came with broken package
,on,11,positive,So over priced !!
,November,2017,negative,"Si tratta di un nastro come dice il nome e non di un filo, è largo circa 2mm ed è sottilissimo. Devo dire che è molto scivoloso e si fa fatica a tenerelo tra le dita in oltre ha un forte sapore di menta che non è di mio gusto. Comprato come prodotto plus costa meno che in farmacia."
,December,2017,negative,Filo interdentale comodo per il fatto che non e di filo ma di plastica/gomma. Da un po l’impressione che non pulisca bene
,October,2020,neutral,È stato consegnato un prodotto diverso da quello descritto: versione alla menta fresca. Questo non era stato indicato da Amazon. Anche l'imballaggio è saltato nel trasporto insieme ad altri articoli
