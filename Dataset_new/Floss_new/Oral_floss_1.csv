,on,8,negative,"Just received few hours ago, normally I research my products better. This type of Oral B Glide floss is made from PTFE, and contains the highest PFAs by far for any floss. It's measured by organic Fluorine which is a marker for PFAs, coming in at about a whopping 248,000 PPM (parts per million), a massive nearly 25%. There are ongoing class law suits against this product in USA.Delving into the 1 star reviews, there are 20+ detailing toxicity of the Glide floss, including one from 2019 with over a staggering 500 likes. Obviously it appears it should be pulled, and this is probably fairly imminent. In my opinion I can't see how anybody would knowingly put this in their mouths."
,on,15,negative,I have about every other dispensers where the floss knots up and breaks. It is so frustrating that I just throw the defective ones away. I think they have some serious quality issues
,on,12,neutral,"No issues with the floss itself, but it was shipped as is (no shipping box or packaging). Luckily no damage to the product itself."
,on,3,negative,"UPDATE: The durability of this product is mediocre at best. One night I broke it off 5 times in a row without trying. Did I just hit the weight room and not know my own strength? Did I just take my vitamins, whey protein and other fitness related supplements so I was 'arm wrestling' the floss? No again. About every 4th or 5th time I use this floss it snaps after I peel off a 16"" piece of rope and give it a go. This is not a compelling argument for leaving the old skool floss in the dust and transitioning to this new skool floss when the durability is this mediocre. I will sniff around for another manufacturer or model type of the flat style floss since I do need to use this style of floss per my perio. At this price point, I expected better.My periodontist advised me that due to my tight spacing between teeth (their is a term for this but it escapes me) and my current gum issues I should move to a FLAT type floss like Glide.I am having some gum issues and my new perio said that there is very little space between my teeth and due to the tight spacing I should go with a flat and wide floss like Glide or others. She says otherwise I will continue cutting into my gums which will lead to problems if it continues.I wish the flavor was WINTERGREEN (my fave), but at least it is flavored. It is a WIDE floss but it seems others I have tried keep their shape better during the flossing. I could be remembering wrong but that seems to be the case. This goes between my tight teeth easily. One thing to avoid is cutting off anything less than 18"" or IMHO the odds of you breaking it increases exponentially. You need a nice loose grip and you want the floss inserted more loosely versus having it as tight as a string on a violin. This helps you avoid breaking it and having to trash it. This quality floss isn't cheap so I don't want to waste it if I can help it.I like the silver container since I am a visual person and I like when things that are out in plain view go with our modern condo's appearance."
,on,11,positive,"Based on this article, I'm concerned about the safety of using this product.  I would appreciate a credit for this purchase.  If warranted, lyou may want to consider pulling this item.  Thanks in advance for any help you can provideYour dental floss might be exposing you to toxic chemicalsAFP Relax News•January 09, 2019Flossing your teeth with certain types of floss could expose you to higher levels of toxic chemicals according to new research.MoreNew US research has found that flossing your teeth -- and certain other behaviors -- may increase exposure to the toxic chemicals linked with a variety of health problems.Led by Silent Spring Institute in collaboration with the Public Health Institute in Berkeley, the new study looked at blood samples taken from 178 middle-aged women to measure the levels of 11 different PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) chemicals in the body.The women, half of whom were non-Hispanic-white and the other half African-American, were also interviewed about nine behaviors that could potentially also lead to higher exposures.The findings, published in the Journal of Exposure Science & Environmental Epidemiology (JESEE), showed that women who flossed their teeth tended to have higher levels of a type of PFAS called PFHxS (perfluorohexanesulfonic acid) in their body compared with those who didn't, in particular when flossing with Oral-B Glide, one of 18 flosses included in the study.In addition, all three of the Oral B Glide products included, plus three store brands, also tested positive for fluorine -- a marker of PFAS -- a finding also in line with previous reports that Glide is made using Teflon-like compounds.The researchers also found that having stain-resistant carpet or furniture and living in a city with PFAS-contaminated drinking water supply were also behaviors linked to higher PFAS levels.Among the African-American participants, those who frequently ate pre-prepared food that came in coated cardboard containers, such as French fries or takeout, also had elevated blood levels of four PFAS chemicals compared to women who rarely ate this type of food. However, the same relationship was not found among non-Hispanic whites, although the researchers are unable to explain why.PFAS are water- and grease-proof substances that are used in a wide a range of consumer products, including fast food packaging, non-stick pans, waterproof clothing and stain-resistant carpets.They have been linked with numerous health problems, including kidney and testicular cancer, thyroid disease, high cholesterol, low birth weight, decreased fertility, and effects on the immune system. Exposure to the chemicals occurs through using products which contain PFAS, eating food that has been in contact with these products, exposure to indoor air and dust, and through drinking contaminated drinking water.""This is the first study to show that using dental floss containing PFAS is associated with a higher body burden of these toxic chemicals,"" says lead author Katie Boronow, ""The good news is, based on our findings, consumers can choose flosses that don't contain PFAS.""""Overall, this study strengthens the evidence that consumer products are an important source of PFAS exposure,"" adds Boronow. ""Restricting these chemicals from products should be a priority to reduce levels in people's bodies."""
,on,19,negative,"Weirdly, the mint flavor floss breaks every other time I use it. The original unflavored version does NOT. Something in the flavoring must be weakening the floss. Don't buy this, buy the original unflavorded version (white packaging)."
,on,13,positive,"I was surprised to find out that it's not a typical floss string, but actually a thing plastic band. Feels weird using it and I don't think it does the job as well as a classic string"
,on,21,positive,I love the feel of this floss. It's smooth as can be and super comfortable to use. The only problem is that it breaks if you hold it to taughtly while using it.
,on,21,positive,This stuff used to be stronger but now breaks frequently so need 2-3x more floss each use.
,on,13,negative,"I urge you to prove it to yourself by phoning the 800 number on the package. I did. It took me 1/2 hour to get a straight talking supervisor to verify for me that Oral-B has hidden a “forever chemical” in their dental floss.Forever chemicals are carcinogens made of fluoride and carbon bonded together so strongly that they will never break down in nature. And 90 to 99% of all humans have these chemicals in their bloodstream. These chemicals are in Teflon frying pans, fire proof pajamas, and foam fire extinguishers.Isn’t it bad enough that unscrupulous companies have been polluting our ground water and air with these toxins for 70 years. Do the powers that be really need to also put them in our dental floss, too? a product that is meant to be put into our mouths and that therefore can come into direct contact with our bleeding gums?Well, Oral-B thinks so. That’s why they call it Oral-B GLIDE floss. Like with Teflon frying pans it doesn’t stick but glides between your teeth. It’s like you’ve got a Teflon frying pan rubbing against your bleeding gums. Disgusting! They should be sued.Here’s the particular version of these fluoride-carbon forever chemicals that Oral-B impregnates its Pro GLIDE floss with… wait for it… I had the supervisor spell it out for me:POLYTETRAFLURCTHYLBNE (or EPTTE for short.)Don’t use this floss. I’m throwing mine out and hope to join a class-action lawsuit against Oral-B to punish them for such blatant malfeasance."
,on,15,negative,"The floss is a pretty wide ribbon, I don't think it digs out debris very well. But the worst thing is that it breaks easily. My teeth slice it right in two, and I frequently have to use more than one piece to get the job done."
,on,26,negative,"I bought these because I've done other toiletry like products (e.g., shaving cream, toothpaste, etc.) in bulk and the value/quality is usually pretty good.  The risk is that you get six of something that isn't very good.  I'm not sure whether this floss has been sitting in a warehouse for a few years or what, but I probably have to go back and get a new strand three to four times to complete one session.  The floss has a tendency to break very easily.  I've bought the same floss at the grocery store or gotten it from the dentist with no problems whatsoever, so not sure why this specific batch is problematic."
,on,27,negative,"Have used samples from my dentist and liked the product.  Not sure if these are a bad batch or Chinese knock off, but they break very easily.  I would say i break once or twice every other use, a bit of an aggravation for sure..."
,on,16,negative,I was a loyal customer using this floss for years only to discover today that it contains PFAS. These are highly slippery and highly toxic chemicals commonly used in non-stick products that have been linked to all sorts of cancers and other health problems.There is absolutely not need for these consumer products to be in dental floss. I'm throwing away this product and never using it again! You should too if you care about your health.
,on,17,negative,"As the title states, this floss and many in Oral-B's Glide line contain PFAS. Not only is it absolutely deplorable to be producing products that make its way into our ecosystem, but to put it in a product used in our mouths, and without disclosing it?! Not sure how this is legal in any way but as a user of this floss for over 4 years I am disgusted by Oral B and P&G for exposing us to this while knowing the risk involved.Instead of taking a random internet reviewers word for it, please Google it. There are studies that talk about PFAS in floss, in particular this floss and referenced in the journal Nature and Harvard.Tossing the rest I have left in the trash... Shame on you Oral B"
,on,27,negative,Product is amazing however the packaging holding the floss is absolutely awful.  The design is wrong and the floss keeps coming out of the plastic holding case.  I got a pack of Sox and happened to all of them.  It really is an AMAZING floss.  Wish they re did the case
,on,15,negative,"I like glide overall … like how smooth it is andHow it glides between the teeth,  But this stuff seems to either shred or tear or rip in half way too frequently and it’s just kind of annoying."
,on,2,negative,I have never had such terrible experience with an Oral-B Guide Pro-Health dental floss product before.These are SO flimsy that I end up using 15-20 pieces (again and again) just to get my flossing done because they tear up as soon as I put it in my mouth.I've been flossing for 20 years now (and I'm not an alligator) so this is not related to not using this product right. It just has extremely poor quality. Would not recommend it.
,on,16,negative,"Quality control needs to be addressed. My last shipment of 6 floss in March 2022 was so poor that I had to throw out half of them. The floss shredded and the mechanism to keep the spool of floss inside the compartment detached and made the floss unusable. The only resort I briefly used was to cut the floss with scissors. I gave up on that after a short while. The garbage bin was the ticket.I had used this floss a good deal in the past and thought it was good. However, whoever produced this last shipment didn't know what they were doing."
,on,6,negative,"This product is no better than the Amazon basics version, but is far more expensive. I suspect that both are made by the same Chinese factory."
,on,12,neutral,I cannot find a expiration date either on the front or the back side of the product.
,on,17,negative,"Disappointing. I’ve used this brand before, but this version is flimsy and breaks easily. This means I end up using three or four times as much as I normally do.  Time to try a different brand."
,on,21,positive,"I was recommended this because its good for tight spaces between teeth and it is, but the problem is that they rip too easily! Still good but have to be very gentle when using."
,on,29,negative,"The package was opened at the top when it arrived and immediately noticed how cheap the dental floss casing and sloppy the label and logo was. Some cases the floss was not wound properly.I didn’t feel comfortable using it, because there is no protective seal on any of the individual packets.Randomly I took out a piece and ran it across my finger to see if it could have been tampered with and a white powered came off. I tried a few other strands from the other cases and no residue came off.As an avid Forensic Files binge-watcher, I immediately suspected it was fentanyl. Considering that I don’t have lab in my home to test the substance, I of course threw it out and washed my hand vigorously.Will not reorder and would not recommend using if the package is opened."
,on,20,negative,"Depending on your teeth spacing, it's difficult to find a floss which does the job without shredding or getting stuck between the teeth.  This one (Glide Oral B Pro Health) didn't work for me)"
,on,10,positive,"My dentist gave me a sampler of this floss and since I used it, I can't go back to regular, so I ordered these. Compared to the sample, i'm quite disappointed to have found that this floss starts peeling and breaking apart during use. My teeth are close together and I do apply a bit of force that all other flosses have survived. So for the price, it's a shame because it's so easy to use, smells and tastes nice, but BREAKS. I love it and want it to be perfect like the dentist sample...!"
,on,5,negative,Bought this because I thought it wouldn't shred. It shreds more than other floss I've tried. Very disappointed.
,on,5,negative,"I always bought this brand of dental floss from my grocery store and had zero issues.I buy it here on Amazon due to the value of the 6 pack, but the quality is noticeably worse. While flossing, almost every time this floss will snap in half with the slightest pressure applied. Never happened before. Not the first time I bought something from Amazon where the quality just isn't the same as the exact same product from a local store."
,on,23,negative,"I have used and liked Glide for many years.  This is the first I have purchased the multi-pack . . . always used to buy individual rolls at the grocery store.  I might have gotten a ""bad"" pack, but I have now tried 3 different rolls, and all have been far inferior in quality to the Glide I am used to.  It breaks and shreds very easily . . . a problem I never had with Glide in the past.  I will go back to buying single rolls at the store."
,on,11,negative,What am I going to do with this mess
,on,3,positive,Everything is fine except it breaks easily. I’ve never had this problem before this floss.
,on,20,negative,"The floss is coated in a toxic nonstick chemical (Study published in Nature dated 1/8/19). They have done studies to prove women who use Glide Oral B floss have higher levels of PFAs in their blood. PFAs are proven to cause high cholesterol, developmental delays in kids, changes to your immune system, thyroid problems and more. They should never be used on food products. That’s why all the nonstick skillets are now advertising no PFAs. I’m furious. I’m breastfeeding and they have proven this gets transferred in breast milk. These chemicals are banned in CA."
,on,12,negative,We used to buy bulk of these at the warehouse club...and its always around this price. Not the cheapest floss out there definitely but ive used several non -Glide ones and they are a PAIN. Shreds of the floss get stuck to your mouth on those cheap floss. Really wish they are cheaper alternatives out there. For now these are the only ones me and my family use.
,on,28,negative,"I have ordered this three times in the last year. The last order, the first two I used broke early on. The plastic case wouldn't close, the the metal pice fell off, and it was extremely frustrating to try to use the rest of the floss. I would have thought it was a fluke, but, the second one had same problem. Too bad, as I really like the floss."
,on,1,negative,"The box broken at the very first time use, poor quality."
,on,24,negative,"We’re the kind of family who switched from nonstick pans to stainless steel to avoid the toxic coatings. Had no idea we were literally rubbing those same coatings in our mouths with this stupid oral-b glide floss. Why is this even legal/on the market? What kind of evil person work think it’s a good idea to poison their customers like this? I know it won’t make a difference to them, but personally I’m never buying ANY oral-B product again. I feel completely betrayed by the brand."
,on,19,negative,"Whenever I use this floss I can't help but remember the reviews that brought to my attention (too late) the dangerous chemicals, which I later looked into and confirmed, but on top of that the floss literally smells like I didn't wash my hands after using torn single ply... no no no no no... it stinks, badly."
,on,2,negative,"I like the floss itself and have been buying it for years but no longer. The last 7-8 dispensers all had spooling problems--the floss would come off the spool, snag, or even split into 2 strands. With every one I had to remove the spool and finish it by using scissors. There is a serious defect with this product. And it isn't cheap!"
,on,13,neutral,The store bought ones don’t fall apart on me.
,on,22,negative,"How pathetic—counterfeit floss. Really? Each and every one of the six flosses in this package fell apart—“floss” material is weak, snags, frays, and eventually the entire plastic container falls open and the “floss” unravels. I’d love to be able to return it if I could but I’ve already almost gone through the whole package after tossing the broken ones and attempting to work with what I’ve got when I’m rushing to get ready in the mornings. This product is not the real Glide floss; if you’ve had the misfortune of ordering this pathetic knockoff do yourself a favor and just pick up the legit floss at a CVS or wherever. The difference in quality is might and day. I don’t plan to use the rest of what I have left because it is truly that worthless. I won’t be ordering dental floss ever again from amazon, and this is not the first time I’ve received a counterfeit product from amazon."
,on,28,negative,The floss itself smells and tastes like a terrible chemical. It's totally different than the same floss I usually buy at Walmart.
,on,15,negative,"Have tried different ways to avoid tearing - no way to avoid. May be fine if sufficient gaps between teeth as to slide in between easily down to gum. But if must use force to get floss down between teeth touching at top, no good - and have similar experience at times, when tear off length of floss from container.Just bought J & J reach - single tough strand as oppose to intertwined, ribbon-type strand - much better for my situation. Slide down without any tearing and thus can do more effective job cleaning gum between teeth"
,on,26,positive,"This floss is the best, and I’ve ordered it from Amazon several times.  But this time the seller — “The Chosen Shop” in Fresno, CA, sent me a different kind of Oral B floss.  I have to go through the effort of returning it."
,on,3,positive,"I was a big fan of the old Oral-B Complete Satin floss . Unfortunately, the new/updated floss has a thinner string which isn't nearly as durable or as good at getting funk out between your teeth. Will not be buying this model again."
,on,23,neutral,Have been using this product for years with no issues. First time buying bulk pack on Amazon and most of the packs were defective. The string would either get tangled or split into two. Half of it ended up in the trash. Seems like they stick the lower-quality ones in the bulk packs.
,on,9,neutral,"I have never had an issue with floss before - it’s a pretty straight-forward transaction. But this floss breaks almost every time I use it. Floss, you had one job! And you failed."
,on,26,neutral,This floss breaks easily. Regular Oral-B floss does not.  Had similar issues with Oral-B floss from Costco. Waste so much floss due to it breaking during flossing. Sticking with the regular Oral-B floss.
,on,15,negative,"when i use the floss with normal force, there is a decent chance that the box break down or the string get clogged. so disappointing"
,on,15,negative,"For 20 years I used Oral B dental floss. It was familiar so I kept using it. Over time, it began breaking more and more often as I was flossing. I think they were using cheaper and cheaper material over time. I switched to a different floss and my teeth are much healthier. I don’t like companies that use their brand recognition to sell customers an inferior product.  Maybe they think we’re dumb?"
,on,8,negative,What can you do when you are unable to get to a store. I was quite shocked to see these tiny flosses...and for $20 ridiculous!!! Never again.
,on,11,positive,Breaks easily.
,on,2,negative,"I think there are many questions out there regarding the ingredients of this product and if it could be toxic.  I believe that it is necessary that this manufacturer show their ingredients and either declare that it is PFAS free or that if it has any similar ingredients that are toxic then declare this.  It is clear from the research how dangerous these chemicals are and the movie Dark Waters is worth watching which explains this.  Since there are no ingredients shown and no declaration that this product is free from these types of materials I will no longer be purchasing.  Toxic to body, toxic to environment...who knows but until I know I am done purchasing."
,on,26,negative,"I don’t mind the floss itself but the mint flavor gets on your hands, lips, and the corners of your mouth.  I don’t like it at all. Not sure how I ended up with the mint version but it’s nasty and annoying."
,on,29,negative,"What happened to Glide?? My teeth are very close together and Glide was wonderful when it first came out. Now, the floss and the container seem to be much cheaper. Floss separates, breaks easily. Container breaks or I have to open it up to get the floss out. After struggling with multiple containers and lots of broken floss I am switching brands. Very disappointing."
,on,20,negative,It's advertised in the picture to be the white floss but comes in as the gray floss and it rips apart in between my teeth during use. so frustrating.
,on,6,negative,The case that houses the floss is flimsy and keeps coming apart
,on,30,negative,I like Oral-B products but this one just doesn't hold up. I'm an avid flosser and this used to be much stronger. Will be looking for a replacement floss that doesn't get stuck in your teeth and doesn't break so easily.
,on,11,negative,"I don't know how you screw up dental floss, but this stuff is absolutely terrible. I have to go through about three or four full strands every time I floss, because they are constantly breaking. If you have tight contacts between your teeth (or sharp teeth?)...then don't waste your time and money on this crap. It's how I would imagine trying to floss your teeth with teflon pipe tape might feel. I suppose it's possible that this is a counterfeit version...not sure why amazon has such a problem with fake dental health products. Guess I'll be shopping at target next time around..."
,on,19,negative,It's floss. It works. But I was surprised at how minty it is. Shockingly so. Warning- Do Not touch your eyes after using this. Mint is strong and it gets on your hands from flossing. I've not noticed this with other brands of mint floss previously. I will not buy flavored floss again after this experience. Now I wish I didn't have 6 boxes to use up.
,on,21,positive,Breaks Way too easily. You're lucky to get one floss out of it without it tearing in half and having to use more.
,on,24,positive,I had been very happy with for years.  But it seems to me that Oral B has maybe cut corners on quality because the last batch that I had would not get through a run through my teeth without breaking.
,on,26,positive,I would like it more if the floss box stayed together
,on,19,positive,This floss is too thick to my tight teeth. It looks much thicker than the picture but the mint smell is good. I'm buying it for flossing not for the flavor. I may send them back.
,on,21,negative,"I'm not sure if they have reduced the amount of material in the floss or what has changed, but this floss is now unusable for me. The slightest snag and the floss snaps. Also shreds much more easily than in the past. Recommend going to a different brand."
,on,25,negative,"The flavor is nice, but this dental floss breaks so easily that you end up using two or three times as much dental floss as you should be using.  It is frustrating to begin flossing and have the piece of floss break and then have to continue the process with a new piece of floss.  At times I have had to use three pieces in a single flossing.  I would never buy this product again."
,on,28,positive,Breaks too easily but otherwise OK
,on,13,positive,"I wanted to love this floss tape because I have been always so pleased with Oral B products. However, when I opened the packaging, the smell of mint filled the room and was overpowering. I love the smell of mint, but the scent of this tape caused my eyes to water and made me cough."
,on,18,positive,"Floss is ok, but breaks very easily with very little pressure applied"
,on,17,negative,"According to a news posting on the Medscape website today (1/17/2019):""Flossing teeth could increase the body's levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) — widely used chemicals linked to a number of diseases and certain cancers — warn US researchers.""""Oral-B Glide and five competitor flosses contained detectable fluorine (including three branded as Glide and two with labels inviting customers to compare the products with Oral-B Glide).""Specifically, flossing with Oral-B Glide was associated with 24.9% higher median levels of PFHxS.""Note: Medscape is a website designed primarily for doctors and health researchers."
,on,19,negative,Takes me around 3 peices to floss teeth as the floss keeps breaking. Very annoying. I will not buy again.
,on,18,negative,"Not what I expected, the floss breaks easily. Also the floss is really big"
,on,6,negative,"This isn't like the old floss, that came in more rugged, durable, darker grey containers.  The cutter falls out, or just trying to cut floss now is a chore. Horrible new design."
,on,9,negative,The plastic housing will pop open everytime I try to pull floss out. Not very good.
,on,10,negative,This floss was okay but my boxes all had trouble dispensing floss. It was like the floss was all folded in half in the package because as I try to use it it’s not flat. It’s a thin line like fishing line. Won’t repurchase.
,on,17,neutral,"This is not the floss to use if you have very tight teeth.  I bought this based on reviews. My teeth are very close together, and the floss always tears. I end up using double the amount of floss."
,on,21,positive,Flimsy outer casing. Keeps popping open
,on,5,negative,There's something off about the design of the housing. The floss slips around and becomes difficult to draw out and cut. If you find a good way around this (such as getting it tucked in where it's supposed to be and then carefully holding a finger over it to keep it from slipping) then this floss works pretty much as well as any other.
,on,16,negative,"I just found out that Oral-B Glide contains one of the highest PFAS (a poison) levels of all floss brands. Why Amazon is still selling it, let alone why it's still being manufactured, is beyond me. Minimally not posting a warning is false advertising."
,on,16,negative,I purchase this brand from my drugstore but this obviously is not the same company.  Each dental floss had something wrong with it so I ended throwing the entire package out.
,on,6,negative,"I bought a six pack some time ago and occasionally had the floss shred or fall apart, but the packet I'm using now, is not usable, falls apart!  I have used three of the original 6 pack, with some difficulty, but this is no good at all, in fact dangerous!!  Buy some other brand!"
,on,5,negative,I am using a TON of this because the floss snaps everytime I use it.I won't be buying this again.
,on,6,negative,Works ok but they break easily. I was expecting a better quality product because of the brand and because it is sold by Amazon. I thought Amazon would ensure that the products that they sell directly vs third-party sellers were high quality because their reputation is at stake. Disappointed.
,on,11,negative,"While I like the Glide products, this one was a mistake. The floss is very fragile and breaks easily when using. I have never had this happen before and was quite shocked when it did. Won’t be purchasing this again."
,on,14,negative,"It does what it's supposed to do, plus more. What's the more, you ask? exposure to PFAS! Unless you like putting chemicals in your mouth, use another product. I wouldn't have bought this if I knew what it contained."
,on,3,negative,I thought they wont break but they actually do maybe not for me
,on,24,neutral,"Compared to the original Glide floss (in the white package), this floss breaks easily when challenged by a sharp tooth or a tight space.  It probably works fine for many people, but not me."
,on,14,negative,"This is the absolute worst floss I've ever used. As someone who's been flossing for 32 years, and never had an issue with any of the brands I've used thus far, I can safely say this floss is basically unusable. I've opened 4 different sets of this floss and each one breaks within 3-4 teeth. I typically use three or four separate strings of this floss every time I need to floss my teeth. I'll be going with the regular brand instead of this one. Stay away."
,on,16,negative,I had the previous purchase of this in front of me when I placed my reorder...I do not think that the thread is the same and does not appear to clean as well. Not awful just not the same...darn.
,on,17,negative,"This is a fake version of what you can buy in brick stores. It will work for the first couple of feet and then gets to weak parts of the spool that break easily. Every unit in the pack is like that. I bought it twice, thinking it was a fluke, same thing happened again."
,on,23,positive,Glide used to be awesome when Gore and later Crest sold it but this stuff just breaks too easy. It shreds too easy and gets tangled up inside the container. And last few orders the containers just fall apart too during normal use. How much worse can it get?
,on,6,positive,Shreds in 3 pieces every time I use it. Wtf. My Kroger floss holds up better than this
,on,23,negative,The floss works about 70% of the time but 30% of the time it breaks while flossing. Not good quality floss.
,on,21,positive,"This dental floss seems to function well in flossing, however, Oral-B Glide has high levels of organic fluorine.  (Re)search PFAS and dental floss.  Or, on amazon ""floss without pfas""."
,on,1,negative,This company is being sued for failing to disclose harmful chemicals in this product. I want a refund immediately.
,on,18,positive,Breaks easily
,on,27,negative,This stuff breaks very easily...the real Glide does not!I'm not sure where or how this seller got this Glide but it must have been rejected by the original manufacturer!
,on,26,negative,"I bought the 6-pack from Amazon because my local pharmacy did not have the Glide.  There must have been a manufacturing defect because I had a problem with all but 1 of the 6 packages.  They would work fine initially, but when you got about half-way through the package, the floss would shred and separate as it came out of the package.  To correct the problem I had to open up the package and realign the floss on the guides. It would then work for a while and start to shred again."
,on,29,negative,"I didn't realize this was ""deep clean"" vs the original floss. Not happy with it at all. It is thicker and is irritating my gums."
,on,3,negative,"This was worse purchase I ever made from Amazon. I don’t know where this was made and packaged but it was a very poor product. Normally I would not order this item from Amazon but because of COVID 19, I did. The floss shredded every time I tried to floss my teeth. The shredded material stuck between my teeth. Now I have 6 packages of it because I’d didn’t start using it until after return date. Never again."
