3.0,October,2021,negative,"My WaterPik pipe broke, and could not fix the pipe. so decided to replace.This is not a replacement for WaterPick. but for the price seems to be worth after initial issues.waterpik I could go upto setting 8 out of 10 but in this using more than 2 is not possible.so then I used waterpik nozzel into this then volla! worked like charm. now I am using setting 5 to get similar cleaning.Company has to carefully check design of the standard nozzle given with this product. compare with nozzle from waterpikanother issue is main switch, its difficult to press the button while doing flossing, waterpik its so easy.Overall its VFM at this moment"

2.0,February,2022,negative,"Bad quality product. The nozzle are designed so poorly. They have such a small hole that the jet also ruptures your gums. You can't even use it at speed of 1. Finally I had to replace it with a nozzle with one that I had from waterpik. That solved the nozzle issue, but the motor is bad too and it stutters."

1.0,June,2023,negative,Not working. Water leakage from the base of jet and spireled water pipe. Not value for money. Also not able to return as its showing non refundable item. Feels cheated
1.0,July,2022,negative,Defective product shipped. No water coming out from the nozzle.Noisy motor indicates motor OK but no water get.but seems water leaking from the tank from the sideways of the unit?From leaflet it works for 2 minutes and auto shut OFF. Seems we must use for 2 minutes only and pack it.Twist pipe very short length and we have to place unit near the hand wash.Waste of money. I won't recommend to my friends.
1.0,February,2022,negative,We have received faulty product after purchased. It's not working . main battery problem when we charged it won't charged . We have to connect with the charger then only it starts but then too water is not coming out from the flosser.If anyone purchasing a new product it should be working . Should not send defective product as we are spending high amount for this product.

1.0,October,2021,negative,"The quality is really had, didn't work as expected. Made of cheap quality plastic. Bought it for my dentist brother on his birthday, and he told to return the product, due to its low pressure. Didn't expect this cheap brands from Amazon."
