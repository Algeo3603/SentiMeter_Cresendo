3.0,January,2024,negative,"Unable to register for warranty, 6 month extra seems gimmick"
3.0,February,2024,negative,"The product is great overall but for sensitive teeth and gum like mine, even the sensation mode feels too harsh."
3.0,January,2024,positive,Really worth it.
3.0,January,2024,positive,Used twice. Seems good.
3.0,December,2023,positive,Average product
3.0,November,2023,neutral,"One nozzle completely stopped working. Cleaned it, but nah nothing changed.The custom is kinda hard to activate.If you're a beginner, use the soft mode or it's gonna hurt so much.This device can really clean the toughest spot. I use it 2 times a day."
3.0,December,2023,positive,Using this one for cleaning the gums and teeth. Good one. Prescription by the dentist.
3.0,October,2023,negative,"Product is OK..but I don't think it can be easily used at home..the water force is too high, and there is a possibility that we can hurt our gums or tongue if the water direction changes even a little.. even with the soft mode, it isn't like massaging the gums and I feel it painful.. giving 5 stars for warranty registration.. probably others too would have done the same.."
3.0,December,2023,neutral,Not powerful enough to dislodge stuff from between teeth
3.0,December,2023,positive,Ok product.
3.0,November,2023,negative,Really efficient product seems to have some issues with its charging option and the customised vibration mode doesn't seem customisable? There are no instructions given for the same.
3.0,November,2023,positive,Writing to claim extended warranty
3.0,November,2023,positive,To improve dental hygiene
3.0,November,2023,negative,Poor value for money and not very effective
3.0,November,2023,positive,Good but need improvement
3.0,October,2023,neutral,"What I like is the product seems okish, what I don't like is forced review for extending warranty."
3.0,October,2023,negative,Maybe it’s just me but this Flosser works only if I hold it absolutely vertically. If I tilt/lean it it starts “gasping” and sucking air. I know there is a pipe that has to be in water to work. Even tjen it’s not working properly.
3.0,November,2023,positive,Seems to work OK. Will review with clinician after using to see if it is effective for me.
3.0,October,2023,positive,Good product
2.0,January,2024,positive,"Exterme HARD to clean inner teeth. Even soft mode has TOO MUCH pressure.It hurts gum.Do not buy if your teeth are good. Hard to use. Use good brush, do normal water kulla.It just looks fancy. Buy if you have a extra money."
2.0,January,2024,negative,The speed reduces with time.and stops aftera 10 sec operation. certainally has quality issues. No response from customer service.
2.0,January,2024,positive,The product is good. Somehow it does not suit me since it causes bleeding of gums whenever I try to use it even if I am running at the lowest speed
3.0,October,2023,negative,Works well. Is powerful enough. But water capacity isn't sufficient for a full wash. You have to refill and the suction pipe keeps getting stuck in the corner. So definite design issues.
3.0,October,2023,positive,"Like, to clean the teeth"
3.0,October,2023,positive,Used it once. Seems okayish.
3.0,October,2023,positive,Working good as of now.
2.0,December,2023,negative,The pressure is too high in normal mode It damaged my gums and too harsh when by mistake the water jet hits softer parts of mouth.Kindly show detailed about how to use in video n manual
3.0,August,2023,positive,Complicated and convoluted  process for product registration.
2.0,October,2023,negative,"I was not able to register the product for warranty. I rcvd some watsapp msgs from some unknown number and asked to share the screenshots of the review and all. I ignored it thinking that it might be a spam. After a few days, i rcvd a MSG that my product registration failed.I am not sure if this is only my experience or everyone's experience."
3.0,September,2023,positive,Good product
1.0,February,2024,negative,"Was in work for 10 days and broke down. The battery doesn't work! How to return it back to the supplier???????Amazone, answer!! Amazon !This is your  responsibility !!!!"
2.0,November,2023,positive,It’s value for money products
1.0,February,2024,negative,worked for less than a year. seven months and it stopped working. poor quality.
1.0,February,2024,neutral,"After full charge, it works only thrice."
1.0,February,2024,neutral,It didn't charge. No quality control.
1.0,January,2024,positive,"This. Vendor uses cheap un reliable courier, without delivering the status will be delivered and you have to run around."
3.0,January,2023,negative,"I bought it on my dentist's recommendation. However I haven't used it yet. But I'm writing this review as the brand wants me to upload a screenshot of the review on the product warranty registration page, which, tbh, is unfair trade practice.Stars I have given are based on nothing.Update: it's a great product. Cleans the space between my teeth well."
1.0,December,2023,positive,"There is hardly any difference between the 4 modes. Most importantly,  the power generated by the unit is pathetic inspite of increasing through the mode button. It is as good as rinsing the mouth as normally done. My suggestion is the power has to be increased multifold like Dr.Trust or Oracura brands. Mine, though purchased 2 weeks ago is lying waste. I bought Orcura OC 300 LITE afew days ago and it is doing its job satisfactorily. I am unable to return your product as the return by date is passed. Sorry as I am disappointed with your product."
2.0,October,2023,positive,Oct 5 first day of use. We will give review again after a month of using. Too early to give review.
1.0,February,2024,negative,Not good for regular use
1.0,January,2024,negative,It is a fragile and  even a defective reconditioned piece.Never again Amazon.
1.0,November,2023,negative,The flosser stopped working in 4 months. Doesn't power on or get charged. Agreed to replace it since it's during warranty period. However it's been 8 days since they agreed to replace and have not received the replacement product. Since I can't stop flossing for weeks together while waiting for a replacement ended up purchasing a new one. Don't see a reason to buy this especially when there are flossers with larger water capacity and usb-c charging available at lower prices.
1.0,October,2023,negative,"Hi all,I have purchased Agaro water flosser from Amazon around June this year, need of the hour of you have dental problems, battery lasts almost a week, only drawback i think so is the capacity as we need to at least four times water filling to do the flossing.Update:Recently there was a problem with my flosser, contacted customer care regarding it. Even after 4 weeks they are saying they will get back but none came. Kindly check before buying . Note: its under warranty period."
1.0,December,2023,positive,
2.0,October,2023,negative,Does not work to expected level. Not recommended to buy
1.0,November,2023,positive,Product is good but stopped working and even after multiple calls to customer service the issue remains unresolved for over 15 days. No wonder people prefer good legacy brands over such new age brands. Waste of money.
1.0,December,2023,negative,"I really regret buying this since it's not returnable. The water pressure is so extreme, even at the soft or normal setting that it made my gums bleed.Please don't waste your money."
1.0,October,2023,negative,They don't sell the adaptor.  I used mobile charge adaptor.  It was fine.  Now it's not charging.  They don't sell the charging cable separately either.  I am not sure if the issue is with the cable or adaptor compatibility or the flosser itself.  The other charging cable costs as much as the flosser itself.  It didn't even work for 3 months.  Waste of money.
1.0,December,2023,negative,Water pressure is too high on soft mode also. Blood started comming from gums in first time use.
1.0,October,2023,negative,"Firstly, the company doesn’t give you a warranty if you don’t submit a review on Amazon. How does one write a review within a few days of buying it. Anyway, so my guarantee is not valid apparently.The product stopped working within 6 months. Useless piece"
1.0,December,2023,negative,Water jet pressure variation causing discomfort.Wanted to return this product.

1.0,November,2023,neutral,"The product has stopped charging within 10 months of use. Useless, don’t buy from this company"
1.0,November,2023,negative,"Didn’t even last a year nonsenseElectricians can’t repairStopped working , not charging"
3.0,June,2022,positive,It is a good product but they do not supply a USB charging plug with it. It is difficult to clean the water chamber and that leaves marks of dried water making the chamber look shabby.
1.0,December,2023,negative,3rd class product.Not getting customer support it's just waste of money
1.0,October,2023,negative,The pressure is too high it damaged my gums and too harsh when by mistake the water jet hits softer parts of mouth. Would not recommend this device.
1.0,October,2023,negative,Product stopped functioning within a month ..this is happened to us twice in 6 months . This is my second purchase .. really unhappy and product quality is questionable..
3.0,November,2022,positive,good
3.0,May,2022,positive,The water comes out very strong and is intact painful. Besides too much water comes out and hence one can do this procedure only during bath. Else you will be wet all over.
1.0,November,2023,neutral,"The product has stopped working , the machine is still working but the water doesn’t come from the other end."
3.0,October,2022,positive,Painful at higher speeds and water drains faster

3.0,March,2022,positive,Good to use
1.0,August,2023,negative,Product stopped after 1 month of use.
2.0,May,2022,negative,pressure is so high that u can't focus on one place. stopped useing after one use only. can't return it also 😖
2.0,December,2021,negative,The device damaged after 8 months ..luckly in the warranty period. It's very useful to remove particles from teeth instead of using thread. But try another quality device as per the advice of your Dentist.
2.0,January,2022,negative,"Doesn't work upto the mark..you have to review first,screenshot it and then you can claim for warranty..but its not worth it at all."
1.0,February,2023,positive,I bought for my personal use. It was very good for first few weeks. Suddenly it's motor died within a half year. Not recommended
1.0,May,2022,negative,"Substandard product replaced thrice with problems of dead battery , Motor making loud noise without delivery pressure, Spontaneous starting without on command. Difficult to use even for a year and only plus point is that replaced thrice. If company do R&D and solve the issues , will benefit everyone"
2.0,October,2021,negative,I have been using Arago product for years. But this one really disappoint me.
1.0,July,2022,negative,I have used the product twice now and it doesn't do what it says. Also you will have to do a lot of hassle before you can use it. Wasn't worth the money.
1.0,April,2023,positive,Too heavy
1.0,October,2022,positive,
1.0,September,2021,negative,This water flosser stops working suddenly and is dead totally. It again starts working after 2-3 hours. There's no reliability of this type of product. I want to return this product but Amazon shows it is now not returnable. I am thoroughly disappointed.
1.0,January,2022,negative,The product is not working. It cannot be used as it is unserviceable.
