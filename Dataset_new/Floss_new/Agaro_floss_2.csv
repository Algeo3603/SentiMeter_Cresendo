3.0,January,2024,positive,"Product is sturdy and handy,,  1st experience is after using this product-needs some practice ,, so looking forward.."
3.0,December,2023,negative,The product stopped working within a year. It goes off within a few seconds of switching on after working very slowly for a two three seconds. I tried recharging also but did not help.  It went not working within the warranty period of one year. Please do the remedial measures at once.
3.0,October,2023,positive,"It's a default review as 3 stars, since company needs a review proof for registering warranty.I'll update or remove this review based on actual product Exprience.So far, it's new and looks good. (But expensive)"

3.0,August,2023,negative,Was not comfortable using so used very sparingly
1.0,February,2024,negative,"The battery died in just 8 months, even after very careful recharging regime. Complete waste of month."
1.0,January,2024,negative,The water tank broke after few days. It seems a weakness in the design of this product. Also Agaro has made it really difficult to claim the warranty (provided it is possible at all).
1.0,February,2024,negative,Didnt last for a year also. Would now yry some other brand
3.0,August,2023,positive,Okay
3.0,July,2023,positive,go for table top once it will more benefit
3.0,July,2023,positive,Nice
3.0,June,2023,positive,It is useful
1.0,November,2023,negative,The product died on us within warranty. We reached out for warranty suport to the appropriate chanels and have gotten no support even after writing over 15 emails. Phone calls to agaro support are hopeless as they delebrately keep a faulty phone like and I can't hear anyone right. While it worked the product was good. But it's built so poorly that water always leaks inside I think and eventually fries the pcb and the product does. This is out third water flosser from this brand and the only one to have failed in warranty. It's obvious that the brand is importing poorly built cheap Chinese products and circulating then under various names. This will surely go to the consumer court. Id love to see this brand banned from trading in India. Sick of this support and consistently poor product quality.

3.0,January,2023,negative,Makes the gums to bleed. Might take some practice to use it. Will revisit the review after a couple of weeks.
1.0,December,2023,negative,Stopped working within a monthâ€¦starts on it own and sprays water all over. When you actually want it to work it does not.

3.0,December,2022,positive,"I used from past few weeks, i think it is value of money for my teeth..."
3.0,July,2022,negative,It's a must have product for oral health but I just wish it had more pressure and an attachment flexible enough to clean internal teeth plagues as well. Not fully satisfied.
3.0,November,2022,positive,The replaced product is now working well.
2.0,April,2023,positive,"This is an excellent tool for flossing, cleans excellent, only drawback is that the water spills while flossing. Probably a proper demo video will help"
1.0,September,2023,negative,I have received a product with no seal with miassing Item. I could not use it but all I can say its not comfortable to hold and and use it through mouth along with this big tank. Very bad design.
1.0,August,2023,negative,"Initially the product worked very well, but in 2.5 months time its performance has deteriorated. The water jet quality has reduced and from the sound of the motor it seems it will stop working any time. The flap for water intake spout is flimsy and has come of itâ€™s hinge."
1.0,June,2023,negative,"I received a defective product while I was out of town. After a week of delivery, when I returned and checked the product, I discovered that it was defective. On the same day, I contacted both Amazon and the company. The company told me to contact Amazon, and Amazon informed me that I should have contacted them within five days of purchase. I am very disappointed"

2.0,August,2022,negative,Please don't spend on this product - this product is not at all helpful for the purpose it is advertised.  Use the cheaper dental floss and regular trips to the dentist
1.0,June,2023,negative,On the box of the product it is clearly written 5 nozzles included but I only received 2 this is unfair also it is non returnable so I have to use it don't buy this product
1.0,April,2023,negative,The container holding the water to use as a water pik or flower was not strong enough to withstand a slip .Have requested for a change but the charges are exhorbitantâ€¦

1.0,March,2023,negative,"After 25 days working stop, not service centre found , complete waste of money, donâ€™t buy any body, it is Chinese kachra ,"
1.0,January,2023,negative,The water flow of this product is so high that it can damage the gums and even the slowest of the settings is fast enough for damage.
1.0,December,2022,negative,"Product should not be used by elders who need Inter Dental cleaning. It hurts, is messy, poor control of flow. Amazon should remove from online platform n refund the exorbitant amount."
1.0,March,2023,negative,It is not at all easy to use..not worth buying

1.0,April,2022,negative,Defective custom mode button doesn't work.
3.0,April,2023,positive,"Used for the first time, difficult to get used to. Will update after 2 months of use. overall nice experience."
3.0,September,2023,positive,"3Sep2023:Like:It does it's job. Battery was charged once over night. I use the product once a day, usage tone is a few minutes, it's been 3 weeks and still running. I only use it in ""normal mode"". Will charge it soon. When used, teeth and overall oral hygiene feels really good. Thank capacity is fine, in my usage i need to retank once. 2 tank fulls is what I require for my flossing. The product does what it was made to do!Dislike:The product stopped working in less than 3 months. The service center was good and cooperative and replaced only the oral irrigator, not the tank. They had me make a video and send it over WhatsApp to illustrate the issue. I had to follow up. They saw my videos and a few days sent a new 1 via courier in a bubble wrap in a box. It seemed new. It did not seem refurbished. It's been a little over 3 weeks, the new replacement's working well... so far.The product's supposed to be waterproof which is one of the reasons why i choose this particular oral irrigator. A bit disappointed it failed and confidence in the product is a little less now. My concern is what if the new 1 also fails. So far, so good. May update this review in case of does fail."
1.0,September,2023,negative,The glosser worked well for a month and then just randomly stopped! I have been trying to call customer care and the call doesnâ€™t go through! This is outright cheating!What makes the whole thing worse is that someone from Agaro keeps following up with me for a good review in return for additional warranty! Agaro is in no place to ask for a review when the product has clear defects!Never buying any of their products again!
1.0,September,2023,negative,Useless because the water pressure will throw you backwards and there's no way to reduce the pressure to gentle and then over time increase it if necessary.The non-returnable nature of the product means you are stuck with it.  Don't waste your money.
1.0,January,2023,negative,"The product is nice, does what it should do.However, I didn't have the charging cable and I realised it only when I wanted to charge it which was after my return window had closed. So I contacted customer service with a request to either send me another cable or provide a link so I could buy one. They took a few days and then came back with ""Sir cable not in stock"" response. Really? I mean are they producing new items without cables?It's a simple cable USB cable but with an unusual charging end. Anyways I'm now left with a dead gadget. Will use it as a paper weight."
1.0,February,2023,positive,"Will recommend you buy from sm1 else.On first try it was so hard that by gums started bleedingThere is a saying ""mehnga roye ek baar sasta roye baar baar"" is best suited.Buy the one where the pick is movable or the tank is separate so that you can use it for inner side of teeth as well"
