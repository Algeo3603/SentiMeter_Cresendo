1.0,December,2021,positive,Worst toothbrush ever
,on,18,negative,"Bought this replacement for my son who had a more expensive model. The problem with Soniccare toothbrushes is they really only last about a year to a year and a half before losing their charging ability. I typically  spend a couple of hundred dollars on a more expensive model,  but this was a great alternative for the cost factor. I  would just like to see sonicare  extend the Toothbrush, life. Unfortunately I have probably had about 10 of these over the last 20 years all seem to lose the ability to charge after a couple of years. Perhaps it’s time to switch to another brand"
,on,19,positive,"Works very well, easy to brush - does all the work for you. Also held charge for about a week after a full charge, with brushing 2x a day. Wish they’d sell cheaper “soft” brush heads but Chinese generics did the trick.Dentists visits were a breeze given how well this toothbrush cleaned.That said, I’ve had 2 of these in the last 7-8 years. My wife has the same model for 5 years now and has had a good run so clearly some don’t last. Mine still works intermittently but the battery doesn’t always charge.I spent about $50 for the brush, so it worked out to a $1 per month (excluding replacement heads), which isnt terrible. Sucks the battery isn’t replaceable so I’ll have to chuck this into a landfill.In conclusion, I would highly recommend buying the cheapest model possible as they all do basically the same thing and it’ll lower your cost to own assuming it dies after 3 to 4 years like both of mine. I just bought the 4100 model for $39 and it works great."
,on,31,negative,"My husband and I both had Sonicare 2 Series toothbrushes for years and they were almost indestructible. They've been stuffed in luggage on vacations, were dropped in the sink, and all of the usual wear and tear did nothing to slow them down. However, after 2 months of owning this version, my husband's toothbrush is going strong, but I apparently have a lemon that has dissuaded me from buying this model again. It started with extremely loud buzzing that you would not want to put anywhere near your face. Then the toothbrush head started swiveling too much, and it would not stay on the base of the brush to even brush my teeth. Next, the battery light flashed, so I promptly put it on the charger, hoping that I hadn't just lost $100 on a toothbrush. Well - now it won't start at all. It's pitiful, just blinking its lights like a crumpled robot, its head all wonky. It worked great when it works, but now it's dead.It looks as though I can send it to Phillips to have it repaired. If you're like me, you've already tallied what an emergency replacement cost plus shipping in hopes that they figure out what's wrong and that I won't waste MORE money. I will avoid this model going forward."
,on,16,positive,"UPDATE EDIT:  I've noticed that on this model the metal stem that holds the brush head wears the socket on the actual Brush head.  Then they don't stay in place.  The brushes become useless before they are worn.  It took 3 weeks to ruin 2 expensive brushes!For decades I've been using UltraSonic toothbrushes. Ever since the very first time they were released on the market.  I have owned 3 Philips Sonicare units.  These seem to run forever.  The batteries have never failed on me.  And after at least 30+ years (I've lost track!) of using this type of toothbrush, my teeth and gums are in great shape.I am not a short term user of these. They won't work overnight miracles.  I floss a couple of times a day and always use a Sonicare toothbrush.  My gums are very healthy and my teeth are white.  I have only had one small cavity in at least 40+ years.At 67 years old, there is no possible way my teeth and gums would be in this shape.  My last 2 cleanings at the dentist, no cleaning was needed at all.These are very fine and well made brushes.  Follow the instructions and angle the brush as suggested.  This will keep pockets from forming and will keep your gums firm and pink.  I have proved this over a very long period of use.  I suggest changing the brushes as the manufacturer suggests.  The Philips brand seems a bit pricey to some people.  Not me.  Worth every penny.  I only bought this new unit because my other one has been used so much, the rubber part of the handle was wearing thin.  My old ones all still work and they still hold their battery charge.  Truly, in my opinion, the very best thing a person can do for their long term oral care is to use these Sonicare toothbrushes.  It will save you dental costs.  It will help your gums remain firm and not recede. and it WILL keep your teeth nice and bright white.  With this unit, used long term, your teeth will never need chemical whitening.  I absolutely swear by the Philips line of Sonicare products.  I'll use them until some new method of tooth cleaning is invented.I have not one negative thing to say about the Philips Sonicare tooth cleaning system.  I have all of my natural teeth except for one rear molar that broke while eating and something hard I bit into broke the tooth.  I had it extracted.  Otherwise I have a great set of teeth and that ain't bad at 67 years old!Floss 2x per day and use a Philips Sonicare.  DO I LIKE SONICARE TOOTHBRUSHES?????  What do you think?"
,on,24,negative,"Terrible quality and durability. Should cost more like $29 rather than almost $100. Bought two of these. One for my partner from another store. The metal pin the brush head slides onto came loose inside the motor while he was using it after only 2 months! Mine started getting louder and louder after a month or two and it ended up being the same issue with that metal piece. It gets louder as it gets more and more loose inside the motor. It will eventually break. If it’s sounding loud to you, make sure to replace it under warranty if it’s been less than a year because mine was super quiet when I first used it. I had the same metal pin issue with my first sonicare 4100 after about 8 months and then the warranty replacement got water under the button after a year or two  and kept turning on by itself. Third one pooped out and just stopped powering on after maybe a year or so. Thought if I paid twice as much I’d be investing in a better toothbrush that mightHold up but apparently the quality is even worse than the cheapest model. The third 4100 (may have been 4200 or 4300) actually was better because it had two intensities. The 3 modes are stupid because each mode requires a special head. Only the gums head comes with it and the other two are like $29 each if you want to buy them. The modes are nothing more than different timed brush modes that are the exact same intensity and pulse. It’s a rip off. Either save yourself $50 and get the 4200 or 4100 that’s half the price and has two intensities or spend a few more dollars to get the 6100 which is $107 right now, has a blue toothbrush and a charging case option plus 3 modes and 3 intensities. It’s just absurd to me that the three modes aren’t even different intensities. Each one is just 30 seconds longer/shorter. Why spend $50 extra for a function that is basically as simple as a simple wind up egg timer. You can just use the 4100 that’s $49, have two intensities and count in your head or use a phone timer. Either way you’ll need the special brush heads."
,on,2,negative,"I've been a Sonicare user for over 15 years and love every one I've owned. Maybe its  genetics, maybe good brushing habits, maybe the Sonicare, but at 28 years old, I've never had a cavity or any other dental issues.I bought this to upgrade from a Series E as it was getting old and pretty gross. My first impression was that it had a lot more power/buzz. It took me a while to get used to this new one as it initially felt a little aggressive. Once I got used to it, it worked great. The travel case is super convenient, the size is nice and sleek, and most importantly, there's no areas that need consistent cleaning out (the part where the brush head attaches to the handle for the series E always gets gross and moldy). The different brush modes are kind of irrelevant since I never switch between them.While there's very little to complain about this brush, after 3 years it died. I noticed the battery was requiring charging more frequently one week, and one day it just died. I've tried different chargers and it seems its dead dead. Some of you might think that 3 years is a pretty good lifespan for an electronic product, and if you do, consider this a 5 star review. But also know that I kept my Series E tucked under my sink, hadnt used it for the longevity of this product, and pulled it out when this one died. Without charging, it turned on, after 3 years of no use and 5 years of use prior.As I've said, I love my Sonicare toothbrushes, but was super sad when this one died. 5 stars while it worked, but super disappointing that my older series E outlasted this one."
,on,24,negative,"This electric toothbrush is great, but it lasted me just over the 2 year warranty and the brush head shaft broke away from the motor. It still works with a death rattle sound, but I can easily pull the shaft right out of the body. Normally I would say I got my monies worth, yet this isn't true as brushing with a manual toothbrush over the last 2 years still would have been much cheaper. I'm not sure I want to go with another electric toothbrush or go back to manual. If I do go with another electric toothbrush it will not be Phillips Sonicare."
,on,30,negative,"There’s a cheaper version of this toothbrush without the brushing modes that I would recommend. Does the same, half the cost. My brush has died on me twice within four years, fortunately the first issue was still within the two year warranty period."
,on,18,positive,Latest 17 months. Should last longer before dieing. Might as well buy an off brand.
,on,15,negative,"I've had three Philips Sonicare electric toothbrushes, and they all ended up the same - after about eight months, the metal stem coming out of the handle becomes loose, so that none of the energy generated by the motor gets transferred to the brushing attachment.  The first two were lower end models so I didn't bother pursuing a warranty claim.  The last one was near the top of their line, and fairly expensive, so when it went south I contacted the manufacturer to get a repair or replacement under the two-year warranty.  I was advised that they would not honor the warranty unless the product had been registered.  Seriously, who registers their toothbrush?  Registration has nothing to do with establishing when or where a product was purchased (which the Amazon receipt does), etc.; it's only purposes are to give the manufacturer an opportunity to send the buyer unsolicited marketing materials, and to provide an excuse for not honoring their warranty.  I would not recommend purchasing a Philips toothbrush, but if you do, I would get the cheapest one (they all seem to last about the same amount of time), and make sure to keep the receipt and send in the product registration."
,on,26,negative,I love the ways this toothbrush cleans my teeth. They feel so fresh after brushing. My dentist tells me my hygiene is perfect and my gum health has improved since I changed from the older version so the gum care mode seems to have measurable improvement.The only problem is that the brush broke down within a year. It started making a terrible noice and had horrible vibrations.Make sure you register your warranty. Hopefully they will figure out what’s with this model. My previous one lasted mor than five years
,on,17,negative,Had this product for just a month and the battery died… this is a $100 toothbrush and the battery life doesn’t last? This is disappointing
,on,2,negative,"Title says it all. Last couple sonicares I've purchased have about a 2 year life before stuff starts falling apart and not working as well. The biggest issue is a gap begins to form between the brush head and brush unit which causes weakened vibrations. There are few brushes as good while this one works, but I'm seriously considering switching brands because of the lack of shelf life on the new models."
,on,2,negative,I love my sonicare toothbrush. And I will buy another one. But I am not sure what to buy ? Current toothbrush just quit .. the head is wobbly and loose .. broken. The one before lasted about a year .. seems like they should last longer ?? Certainly more than 3 months.
,on,12,negative,My only negative comment is the G5 brush is not a Medium firmness.  Seems very soft to me.  Every other aspect is fine.
,on,13,negative,"So. this electric toothbrush for cleaning purpose is average. Nothing to write home about. The thing about this toothbrush is that it is extremely noisy. By noisy,I mean that this thing could wake the dead or at least the house up if you're up early trying to get ready while the rest of the house is sleeping. The buzzing noise almost reminds me of Chewbacca complaining that he doesnt want to brush.Seriously, I feel bad that just because Im brushing my teeth in the morning, Im going to wake up someone and my house is not that small.So if you want an average cleaning and don't care about the noise factor, then by all means buy it but if you love your family/roomies at all I would highly discourage it.I'm in the market for finding something else, I just cant take it anymore."
,on,22,positive,"When I had it and it worked, it was great. However, only lasted 6 months before it broke. Battery life shortened quickly and the head of the tooth brush is loose now which is why it’s not working properly."
,on,29,negative,Great toothbrush for about a year and then something mechanical breaks in it and will stop working entirely. This is the 3rd time I have purchased this toothbrush. I don't think I'll do it again.
,on,7,negative,Works for a week or two before now making a really really loud sound and the touch sensitive alarm no longer functions also the vibrations are much too strong. I read online at a screw can come loose but this really shouldn't be a problem . I guess it is a problem and so here's my review.
,on,26,negative,"This model vibrates much harder and is much louder than my previous sonicare brushes. Feels harsh on my teeth. I recommend getting one with the sensitivity setting, such as the model 6100"
,on,30,negative,"I am someone who really cares about teeth.  I have white teeth, I go for cleanings twice a year, rarely have had a cavity, etc.  My dentist and hygienist both recommended the Phillips sonicare.  There is nothing wrong with the toothbrush; I just don't like it.  For what it costs, I truly do not think it cleans your teeth any better than a manual toothbrush.  I have noticed no difference.  Except with this, I end up having toothpaste running down my chin, I'll bump other teeth with the head of it while it's running and it feels odd.  I really wanted to like this, but I just don't.  I'll probably end up giving it to my mom (with clean toothbrush heads of course).  If you are in doubt, save your money.  Don't buy it.  If you like electric toothbrushes, you'll probably like this."
,on,1,negative,After 5 months it's very loud and the vibration is now so strong it hurts my hand.It is easy to replace under the 2 year warranty though!
,on,28,negative,Great brush and cleans teeth really well. Disappointing you have to go through a full brush to get to a different mode so I’ve never used the other modes. So loud that my husband is making me get a new brush because it’s unbearable.
,on,15,positive,Of course the “product support window” ends in September 2023 and the toothbrush stops working in October 2023. Funny how that works..
,on,17,negative,"I have been using Sonicare toothbrushes for YEARS.  They are great, and I never had any complaints -- until now.  The battery on this model got continually worse starting around the 3-year mark, and stopped holding a charge altogether at around the 4-year mark.  And since the battery is not replaceable, now this product will add clutter to a landfill.My other Sonicares usually died because the physical button wears out -- after 8-10 years!  I have never had one with a battery that stopped holding a charge, and certainly expected the battery to last a lot longer than it did.Maybe I got a dud, or maybe they're using cheaper batteries.I'm switching to Oral B."
,on,2,negative,"This review is more about the Philips customer service, than the product.  The products are good, though they do seem to stop working after a year or two.  However: Service chat is really poor.  I asked a simple question: how to get the free brush head when registering product, mentioned on the paper slip in the box as '6 months extended warranty and free brush head offer.'  It took me AN HOUR on chat to pursue this.  It took them 30 minutes to conclude they would honor their written offer, then they disconnected my chat.  I re-initiated another chat and the 2nd chat agent said I had to subscribe to a brush head subscription replacement service.  It took another 30 minutes to get them to agree to honor their written promotional materials for the 'free brush head offer,' which they only did 'as an exception' and 'one-time courtesy' (the second agent said) when I uploaded a photo of the written offer.  This is either very poor chat service, or very false advertising in the materials that come with the brush.  It makes one want to try their competitors."
,on,30,negative,i got it to brush my teeth and it does that but the ad had a number of heads and in actuality there is only one. i hopei can find another at a decent pri ce
,on,27,negative,"Definitely happy with how well this toothbrush cleaned my teeth. However, I purchased in July and now in October it has completely stopped working and won’t even come on. Pretty disappointed as I recommended my boyfriend to buy one as well and because it was a pretty penny to purchase so my expectations for quality and longevity were higher than 3 months."
,on,21,negative,"I've been a repeat customer of Sonicare for years, but this recent purchase has me questioning my loyalty. The sensitive toothbrush head that I use in place of the one that comes with the package doesn't seem to deliver the clean teeth I've come to expect from Philips. The decline in quality in the 2.5 years since I purchased my last rechargeable toothbrush is really noticeable."
,on,17,negative,"After 5 months of use, the head of this device became loose. I had to spend an hour prying it open, watching YouTube, and tightening the screw which did fix it. But why did i have to go through this hassle? They should ensure all pieces remain tight"
,on,6,positive,The toothbrush is no longer holding up at just 6 months. I’ve had other sonicare versions for years so hopefully mine was just a lemon.
,on,1,negative,"A slippery toothbrush, easy to drop and break.  If the brush falls on the ground, on the brush end, too many times, it will be broken.  They seem to have designed this so that you accidentally drop it."
,on,11,negative,"I have been using Sonicare for over 15 years. I bought this toothbrush in June 2023 and it just broke. The previous one I purchased in 2021 and it also had the same issue -- the metal part that connects the brush head to the toothbrush became loose from normal use (brushing teeth twice a day at most). This is unacceptable for such an expensive product. I will not be purchasing Sonicare after this, also because there appears to be zero product support from the company. I hate to sound like an old person but, well, they don't make 'em like they used to any more."
,on,30,negative,Beware after the warranty this stopped charging 18 months and it won't charge anymore I am very disaapointed
,on,1,positive,I am a huge fan of Sonicare toothbrushes and currently own a couple. One is this model and the other is Sonicate HealhyWhite which I purchased in 2021.  HealthyWhite is working with no issues and gets used about 60% of time. The ProtectiveClean however worked great for about 9  months and then only one of the 3 modes could be selected.  Shortly after the whole thing failed. What a waste of money.  (This is the 2nd Sonicare ProtectiveClean 5100 that I've owned - the first one lasted 2 years).
,on,23,negative,"The function for Clean, White & Gum care are all the same speed and hardness.  My former toothbrush had different speeds for these same feature.  Something is not functioning properly???????"
,on,26,negative,Previous Sonicares seemed to last longer. I’ll stick with the lesser expensive models. Having used both I don’t see a discernible difference in cleanliness.
,on,14,negative,Broke after 2 years of use. Shaft on top seems to have broke somewhere below the rubber boot. Now the shaft easily moves back and forth and makes a horrible noise.
,on,23,negative,For the price shouldn't this thing last longer than just shy of three years? My husband is still using a Sonicare from 2008ish. Purchased this in January of 2020. Now it needs replaced.  The reason I bought a Phillips is because how long our original has lasted Didn't at the time of this purchase and still doesn't have any issues today. Nobody makes anything that lasts anymore. Sad.
,on,5,negative,I cleaned and charged quite regularly. It quit after 6 months after multiple attempts trouble shooting. Amazon did not offer any ways of communicating problems with manufacturer.
,on,15,neutral,The battery is not charging anymore. A waste of 80$
,on,1,negative,I had this product for a year and it no longer works. Started cutting out 3 months ago..
,on,14,negative,"lack of compatibility with other Sonicare accessories, particularly the charger. This electric toothbrush does not work with other Sonicare chargers, making it inconvenient and frustrating. It's surprising that a product within the same brand does not have cross-compatible accessories, limiting the flexibility and convenience for users. I use to have the diamond and now I have paper weight chargers now. Use it was also a universal charger with usb c so i dont have to carry our so many plugs."
,on,27,negative,"I really loved my previous Sonicare toothbrush, it lasted almost 7 years without any issues, so I decided to buy another one. But apparently the product quality for the new model is much lower than for previous models! After only 3 months of use the toothbrush is broken, the vibration started to get less intense and noisy and the toothbrush head would not fit well anymore which causes it to wobble in all directions. Now when you do some research this seems to be a common issue. I called Philips customer support and luckily my purchase was still under warranty so I got a new toothbrush."
,on,26,negative,"After using this toothbrush for about six months, the damn thing started falling apart. The head connector loosened do the brush now wobbles when you use it."
,on,22,positive,"This replaced a previous sonicare toothbrush that I’d had for 10 years. First impressions were good. However after only 6 months something broke inside. You can hear it rattling when operating, and the toothbrush attachment hardly moves now. Tried new toothbrush attachments same results, Despite trying both Amazon and Philips support, no help and no replacement. Save your money and buy something else."
,on,19,negative,"No idea why or how, but suddenly the metal rod that holds the toothbrush head is loose. This is causing the entire unit to vibrate LOUDLY (more than usually) and the toothbrush head doesn't seem to be moving as it should. Very disappointed it did not last longer for the price."
,on,2,negative,Stopped charging after two years. I purchased this model to replace another one now used when I travel. The older model is still going strong. Both heads have a tendency to pop off the unit which is annoying.
,on,6,negative,My first one lasted 2 years. The last one just broke after 6 months. Not good enough for the price!
,on,8,negative,The tip mount became very wobbly after 3 months... Its annoying. I dont think id buy this again.
,on,8,positive,"The packaging boldly advertised that it contained 1 electric toothbrush, 1 recharger, and 1 brush head. The box contained the electric toothbrush, and the recharger, but NO brush head. Bait and switch? You decide!"
,on,12,negative,"I’ve used Sonicare products for over 15 years and absolutely love them! Unfortunately, my units usually breakdown after 18-24 months — the metal tip where the brush inserts over usually breaks off or simply becomes useless. My last Sonicare brush was the expense DiamondClean (HX9352/04). Best product I’ve bought to date, but after a year, that too broke down so I decided to cut a corner and purchase this toothbrush.I’m not a fan at all. The power is very weak, even after a full charge. I thought it came with 4 speeds, but it only has 3, and each of the 3 speeds are about the same; very difficult to determine which speed is which. To change speeds, you must stop the unit instead of having the ability to change speeds while the unit is in use.If you’re going to purchase a Sonicare toothbrush, I highly advise coughing up the extra cash to purchase a top end model. I’m not sure why this model is rated so high in reviews, but my guess is most reviewers are new to Sonicare brushes and innocently don’t know the difference between great Sonicare brush vs. a mediocre one."
,on,30,negative,"When it worked it was great. But it only lasted 9 months before an internal screw became loose and couldn’t work properly.  There was no excessive wear and tear, it just shook loose."
,on,14,negative,"It was great, but after 3 years it's suddently now really loud, with or without a head attached (so it's the unit itself, not the brush head that's the issue).  I paid way too much for it to break like this, and I only use it once a day.  My last electric toothbrush lasted over 10 years and I used that twice a day, and the only reason I had to replace it is because of exterior issues, not mechanical.  What a disappointment, and I was a first-time Philips user, I guess I'm going back to Oral-B."
,on,18,neutral,"I am disappointed that I don’t receive 3 different functions.  All of them feel the same on my teeth.  It was great at first, but now I would like the pressure to be less at times, because it is affecting my teeth.  The reason why I opted for the more expensive 3 functions is if I didn’t want too much pressure I can lower it.  I don’t feel a difference between white, clean nor gum care.  I am quite concerned about using it all the time.  After 2 weeks of use and the functions are all the same high pressure, my teeth are feeling a little sensitive.  Unfortunately, I think I have to return this product."
,on,30,positive,"I love this brand of toothbrush. But after eight months for some reason mine stopped charging. I’ve now it’s been an hour and a half on GPT chat and in a telephone call trying to get my toothbrush replaced. I kept asking for the serial number, which wears off of your brush if you use it. When you spend $100 for a toothbrush, it should last more than eight months."
,on,4,negative,I bought this as a gift. It stopped working 10 weeks after first use and Amazon would do nothing to help me. They gave me the phone number to the manufacturer and told me to call them. I called~ waited on the line for over an hour and never got through. So disappointed in Amazon as they could have offered a refund or return the defected product for a new one. We have spent $$$ at Amazon for years and would never have thought a $100 toothbrush would not be guaranteed. Don’t buy this toothbrush because it looses charge and won’t work. It was only used for less than 10 weeks. And we are seriously thinking of cancelling business with Amazon.
,on,29,negative,"As soon as I received this toothbrush, I immediately charged it overnight. The next morning, I went to use it and it would not turn on. I noticed that there is a very rapidly blinking light when it is charged. It seems something is wrong with the battery. Either way, it's never a good thing to purchase an item that doesn't even work once.Further, the item is supposed to come with multiple brush heads, a standard one, one meant for the gums, and one for the tongue if I remember correctly. Mine only came with one standard brush head.I'm not happy with my purchase and now I have to go through the hassle of returning it."
,on,11,negative,Had the other one about a year . It started to not charge
,on,23,negative,"The toothbrush stopped working immediately after the warranty expired.  It turns itself on by itself and won't charge.  It's unuseable. It was great while it lasted, but I wouldn't spend $87 for a temporary toothbrush."
,on,28,negative,"Toothbrush worked well, I liked the timer feature and the reminder to swap the heads now and again. However, it only lasted about 2.5 years. Given how expensive this toothbrush plus the heads were this seems like a net negative compared to a more standard toothbrush. Would be worth it if it just didn't suddenly die. Now it just blinks rapidly and refuses to charge. Seems I'm not the only one to have this issue..."
,on,7,negative,"I had my last Sonicare for several years and it worked great - only reason I ""upgraded"" was because I thought the newer model would have better functionality and battery life.  The charge on my last Sonicare would last for months with 2x daily use.  This one barely lasts 2 weeks, if I'm lucky.  Not sure if I just got a bad battery in mine or what, but it's annoying to use with fading vibration after 1 week.  Now I just leave it on the charger all the time, which seems ridiculous.  Also, the plastic and weight of this model just feels cheap.  Weird given the price, but whatever, I guess."
,on,16,positive,"I purchased this product in August 2020. Battery life was great, and I took it with me whenever I traveled. This product was great, until right at the two year mark when it stopped working. The center piece is no longer held in, and doesn’t transfer the vibration power to the brush anymore. Well it was good while it lasted. Planned obsolescence strikes again."
,on,26,negative,Not the best device I’ve owned. I’m more inclined to return it due to its poor performance. I wouldn’t recommend this product. Sorry.
,on,6,negative,"This is the first of two sonicare toothbrushes that within a few months has started vibrating itself to death. This toothbrush vibrated itself apart, actually coming apart!17 years ago, I purchased my first Philips sonicare, and kept the base in use for nearly 15 years. I bought lots of replacement heads of course, but that original Philips sonicare was awesome. I finally retired it because my dentist was a big fan of the new sonicares, and I’ve regretted that decision ever since.I thought perhaps this Philips Sonicare ProtectiveClean 5100 was simply a lemon, a rare bad batch or something. So instead of contacting Phillips and asking for a refund, I bought a newer model, the diamond something from Philips sonicare. Unfortunately, same story, after a couple of months, the new one has started vibrating itself apart and after two fillings fell out I am scared to use it.I’ve contacted Phillips after the second new purchase  to ask them to send me a replacement, they haven’t yet, and asked me if I had charged this device appropriately. Heck yes, I followed all the instructions, keep it clean, do a good job with it, it should work perfectly. Instead, it’s vibrating apart, feels like a jackhammer, and makes the noise of a jackhammer busting up concrete. Help!"
,on,13,negative,The battery on this thing is terrible. 6 months in and it only lasts a week before I have to recharge it.
,on,4,negative,The metal piece that the brush attaches to broke after a few months.
,on,6,negative,"Worked great for 5 months and then suddenly the base metal connection rod to the toothbrush head became loose and vibrated uncontrollably, nearly ejecting the toothbrush head off the unit.  I tried using new toothbrush heads, but found that the toothbrush head was not the problem.  I really like this toothbrush but must given this review a low score."
,on,27,negative,"I was always afraid of teeth. I'd say its close to a phobia level of fear. I've had several bad experiences with dentists that triggered this. Thankfully I am with a trusted dentist who knows his stuff and understands that I am a huge puss when it comes to teeth and dentists. I purchased this due to a remaining Amazon gift card balance and a $15 coupon offered through the product's page.I just received it today and just tried it out. Very gentle on my teeth and you can actually feel the difference in how clean my teeth are compared to using a traditional toothbrush.5/5 would brush again, Odontophobia approved.UPDATE:Wasn’t a fan after a few days. Made my gums hurt even with the gentle gum mode. I found out that sonicare tooth brushes tend to make a persons gums recede. Thankfully Amazon has a great turn policy so I returned this product and ended up getting an oral b tooth brush from my gfs mom."
,on,20,negative,"I bought this toothbrush in March of this year and it only lasted until about a week ago when the metal piece was not properly tight and it started vibrating and making a horrible noise and I don't think there's anyway in the world to fix it and I'm sure the company wouldn't do anything about it. Anyway, I wouldn't bother buying the stupid bus if I were you!"
,on,12,positive,"I've owned 2 Phillips brand electric toothbrushes. They both lasted a few years, this one only 7 months."
,on,10,negative,"Good electric toothbrush, but poorly designed. After using it for only 2 months or so, the screw holding the rod that the brush head fits on came loose, making brushing not possible. This is a common problem apparently. Every youtube video I watched on how to fix this problem showed that it was easy to take apart the toothbrushes. Not the case with this model. There isn't a simple screw at the bottom keeping the bottom on, instead you need a thin knife to pop off these annoying clips that hold it into place. It's almost impossible to do this without damaging the body. I had to do this so many times that the bottom was no longer sealed and it eventually got water damaged. Buy a different toothbrush, this isn't made to last"
,on,7,negative,"Welcome to 2019, where we call evil good, and dumb smart. Our devices keep getting ""smarter"" & we keep getting dumber. Do not be fooled by the stylish, sleek, minimal, modern garbage design of this vibrating salesperson. The developers of this toothbrush want you think its the TOOTHBRUSH THAT REALLY CARES ABOUT YOUR HEALTH, but it really only cares about taking your money and controlling your behavior. Tools are to be used, not to use you. Don't be the tool in this mouth to mouth relationship.This toothbrush thinks its so smart and knows your mouth so well that it shuts off automatically when it thinks you've brushed enough. So annoying. I guess I'm just supposed to roll over and say ""OH SMART AI TOOTHBRUSH, THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME KNOW MY MOUTH IS CLEAN."" Back in the old days when they made toothbrushes the normal way, you were allowed to brush until you FELT like your mouth was clean. Not now, we must bow down and worship the techno device.Secondly, this toothbrush will SHUT OFF AUTOMATICALLY when it deems it necessary to replace the toothbrush head... Even though my toothbrush head is in great condition, it will stop brushing my teeth for like 3 seconds and buzz until I pay$2.50 every 3 month to replace the head. Pure stupidity. This is one stylish money trap. Most people will probably just buy this and change their behavior to appease the angry toothbrush, but not me! Returning this and going to buy a dumb toothbrush for little ol dumb me who can't get with the new techno age. So ready for Jesus to come back & destroy this beast."
,on,14,negative,"This was a great little toothbrush right up until the moment it stopped working. I contacted Amazon customer service for assistance. First 4 attempts requesting a call back were ignored - no call ever came. On day 5 I decided to try the chat option instead. The operator first of all asked me to dismantle the toothbrush using tools I had never heard of and certainly do not possess. Then when it became clear I was not a handyman equipped to tackle this job with my spurger and square grip slotted tool??? they then tried to pass me off to Phillips telling me that since it was over 30 days since my purchase they were not required to do anything for me. When I further questioned and attempting to escalate this I was refused the opportunity to speak to a supervisor, told I would need to call in and start the entire conversation again with someone different, and that 'Pau' was not allowed to give me their actual name to even attempt to link the conversations. Really disappointed with this service. I have worked for Amazon for almost 5 years, I love the company, but this is without doubt one of the biggest Customer Obsession fails I have witnessed to date. To take the stance yes we sold you a defective product, we don;t dispute that, but since it worked for the first 3 months its not our problem now. You can take your chances with the people who made it or buy another one, those are your only options. Well frankly I am astounded. What happened to being the World's most Customer Obsessed business? What happened to Ownership, Insist on the Highest Standards, even Bias for Action. Very disappointing."
,on,28,negative,"This is not the best Sonicare toothbrush. I guess they are using cheaper and cheaper parts inside to save money. At this price ($80 with tax) it's better to add money and get one or two models up.This toothbrush is very loud and it feels like some parts inside are not connected well. Also the brush's head is not the most convenient one. We owned Sonicare before and this is not the best out there. It still does the job, but for such function you don't need to spend this much money."
,on,31,negative,Great product but it last for less than a year. Extremely disappointed with my purchase.
,on,24,negative,"The brush was great while it lasted.  My teeth never felt so clean.However, the vibrations got too weak to use after about a year and a half.  I got it replaced under warranty and the second also lasted about a year and a half.Philips declined to replace the replacement (despite my having registered it and it listing a warranty date in the future), instead giving me a 15% discount code to their shop.So, good at brushing, but doesn't seem to last very long for a $100 toothbrush."
,on,4,negative,"Mine was working great for the time that I had it. The timer function is phenomenal and my teeth noticeably felt cleaner and became whiter.However, the battery life is not that long. I feel like the flashing light to indicate that it needs to be charged pops on 3 uses after I fully charged it.The brush heads are just ridiculously expensive for what they are, after the running out of my second batch I bought 3rd party brush heads that work great but just don't fit perfectly.Now my brush is just a couple months over a year old and it is shot. If I charge it up it will randomly start vibrating while on the charger, then when I take if off of the charger it will be fine for a few hours then it just turns itself on and won't turn off until it runs out of power. So the handle is now completely useless and just out of warranty. For the cost of this I would have expected it to last longer.After reading through other's reviews I can see I am not the only one to have their handle break around the 1 year mark. Most of philips' healthcare products even have 24 month warranties but they only have a 12 month warranty on their brush because they know it will likely break before 24 months.I loved it while it worked but now I am very disappointed for the money I spent on this for it to just break."
,on,30,negative,After return window expired both units became very loose and loud. Have not been able to get anyone to assist with a return of the item. I thought I purchased warranty but could not found it in my order history.
,on,2,negative,"While i liked this toothbrush while it was functioning, the metal pin become lose after ~10 month of use.  This is a similiar issue other reviewers identify.  Disappointed in the quality for the price point."
,on,28,positive,
,on,24,negative,"This toothbrush broke after 6 months. The section of the toothbrush that the toothbrush head should be attached to came loose, so when it’s used it makes the loudest buzzing sound. Wouldn’t recommend"
,on,2,positive,Toothbrush shorting out after a couple months.
,on,20,negative,"On 2.11.2023 I received this product. I have used similar Phillips Sonicare electric toothbrushes. For about 4 yrs since switching from similar.Today.......6.20.2023.....the above product has been failing for weeks now. And finally I am buying a stronger, better built product.I confirmed that this above product is exactly what I bought on 2.11.2023. For $89 I would have thought this product from Phillips Sonicare would have lasted much longer.If there is anyone reading this review and you can tell me which Phillips Sonicare product to pay more for and know it will work, I would appreciate a recommendation."
,on,3,negative,"This tooth brush does a good job of cleaning. However, do we really need a toothbrush with Wi-Fi? Supposedly to remind us to change our brush head? The brushes are expensive. It reminds me of the printers which are cheap but the printer cartridges which are expensive to replace. Do not recommend!"
,on,19,negative,I would like to know the warranty on this product?  It is not working correctly.  The post that toothbrush fits on is loose and wiggles.  Please advise.piece is not missing it does not hold the brush correctly.  I would like a replacement unit
,on,10,negative,"First of all, when they do work, these clean great and are far superior to a traditional toothbrush (which I why I keep buying them).That said, I'm very disappointed with the longevity of them over time and what feels like planned obsolescence.  I'm on my second one of these which I bought a little less than a year ago, and it has already stopped working correctly.  The vibrating action has become dramatically weaker, and it no longer feels like it's doing a good job cleaning.  This is the same thing that happened to my first version of this toothbrush, but that one at least lasted 3 years.  Overall not impressed with this - I'd hope to get at least 5 years out of an investment like this..."
,on,21,negative,Bought the end of Sept. Part u put toothbrush head on already broke.
,on,9,negative,"Within a month of use the brush head fell off the brush handle. The head won't stay in place. The brush had excessive vibration and noise, injuring gums and causing headaches. I asked Amazon for return, but the brush was now outside the refund window. I went to Philips under warranty return. Philips quickly mailed me a replacement brush handle (only) and an envelope to return my brush in use. I installed my old brush head on newly shipped brush handle, and shortly the same problem - The brush head fell off the new handle.I am not able to use the product since Sep 2020, which is not cheap either. Finally, I have returned the newly supplied brush handle back to Philips and trashed the Philips Sonic Care brush set purchased from Amazon (used for three weeks only), as I am out of patience to work with Philips and their product.I have used Oral-B from past 8 years and it never let me down (It still works). I will buy a new Oral-B product, which is worth the money."
,on,24,negative,"Absolutely loved this toothbrush. No exaggeration, I actually enjoyed brushing my teeth for the first time in my life. Unfortunately, something happened with the motor within 3 months and the vibration stopped working properly. The toothbrush doesn't vibrate nearly as strong and it's now super loud. My husband recently purchased the 6100 series, so let's see how long his lasts."
,on,4,neutral,"6 months in and the battery not only won’t hold a charge, but it won’t charge at all. I owned the cheaper model for 5+ years without issue; this unit failed in 6 months. Don’t waste the money."
,on,6,negative,"Sonicare bases usually last me years. The base of this model broke within 4 months of purchase. The head now wiggles when the toothbrush is on. I thought it was loose at first, which can happen, but it’s the pole on the base itself. This is the first time I’ve ever had an issue with sonicare. I’d buy another model."
,on,10,negative,"I bought this toothbrush for my husband in March 2023. It stopped working completely in Dec. 2023 out of the blue. Only regular daily use, no extreme conditions or misuse. Lasted less than a year! Very dissatisfied."
,on,30,neutral,I purchased this Sonicare toothbrush in September 2022 and the metal stem where you attach the brush head came out after only 8 months of use. This is not a well-made toothbrush. Buyer beware.
,on,27,negative,The tooth brush had very low power to clean and brush always seemed to slip off. had better products before would not recommend
,on,30,negative,"I had given this a 5 star review but it got filtered out for no good reason. So now you get a 1 star. Nice job! You just spiked yourself in the foot. So to anyone who hates being moderated and filtered for no reason at all, go buy something else. FYI, automods don't work, justask youtube."
,on,29,negative,This is going to be my 3rd one in 1 year.The ends break and stop 'sonicing' the brush. It ends up being an expensive manual brush.I'm going to try to have Sonic replace it.
,on,25,negative,"After only 5 months of use it just started stopping / cutting out. It started losing it's power. I tried ""activating or deactivating features"" but that didn't help.In short, expensive and useless. Not recommend!."
,on,29,negative,"First off this brush is overly aggressive and causes your gums to wear. Secondly it breaks. Mine broke after 1 year. Read the 1 star reviews, after 5 months up to 1 years the metal pin that holds the  brushhead on breaks. Then it's useless. Sonicare used to mean quality. Now it means ripoff. Amazon should stop selling this model because Sonicare is knowingly selling a product with a serious fatal defect."
