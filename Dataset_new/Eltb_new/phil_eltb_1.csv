1.0,October,2023,negative,"After using this device for over three months, I can confidently say that it's an excellent product that functions exceptionally well. Initially, I was hesitant about investing in an expensive toothbrush. However, electric brushes clearly have the advantage of being gentle on the gums. They operate by brushing your teeth thousands of times within a brief period – a speed our hands can't achieve. Moreover, they provide focused cleaning rather than prolonged brushing against the gums and tooth roots, thus preventing gum damage.However, I'm deeply disappointed by the unavailability of official replacement heads. I reached out to Philips Customer Care, and while they did ask for my phone number, they never followed up. I'm not comfortable purchasing third-party parts.Given the cost and the lack of support, I regret my purchase. I wish I had explored other brands that offer replacement heads as well."
3.0,December,2023,negative,"I am writing this review after one year of use. Power button went nuts. It starts and shuts down randomly. Silicon button got peeled away. Other than that, it does the job well.I own couple of philips products. I observed they stopped working right after warranty period or just before warranty period. So, They wont last long. Don't pay premium on cheap products. Better buy other cheap products which promises quality.I am planning to buy a new one after a year of use."
3.0,January,2023,negative,It's extremely expensive and you will encounter many problems to replace head so better avoid it. I have yet to see benefit.I made a mistake by going for this better check some cheaper one whose head replacements are available
3.0,June,2022,positive,"This is my first time using an electronic toothbrush. For new users like me, it takes a bit of time to get used to it especially the vibrations. Apart from that the product is super cool with a sleek design and easy to charge. I wish it had an adapter with it that would have helped a lot. Also it might be difficult for people with sensitive teeth to use it die to its sonic nature. However it makes teeth super clean. I have yet to experience its effect on plaque which actually looks like it can remove it easily."
2.0,March,2023,negative,"The brush only lasted for 6 months (appox used it 300 times), the start/stop button is worn out The battery life is poor. I’m still not able to figure out whether charge is full even after charging it for 8 hrs. The brush automatically turns off and turns on after 5 months. Spending close to 3.5K (including spare brush heads) isn’t value for money. I will give 2/5 for the product.Note: New product offered at Rs.1250/- is opened/used product. Be careful while buying as this is a non returnable product and Amazon doesn’t care about customer service."
2.0,March,2023,positive,"Product is good in terms of quality, but it does not comes with extra head. Replacement heads of product are already too expensive, making a daily usable product very expensive.I will recommend anyone buying this to look for other alternatives before investing."
2.0,February,2023,negative,First thing that I noticed is this thing comes with charging stand and does not have a USB port in the brush handle. What kind of user experience is it? It practically ruins the portability of this thing. How hard is it to put a USB c port for charging? Why on earth anyone do this. And this stupid thing is non returnable.The charging stand does not hold the brush firmly either.
1.0,October,2023,negative,Do not buy within 3 months of use it started to malfunction and customer service is very poor service center told they will give a replacement but after 3 month still not received the product so approached consumer court
1.0,April,2023,negative,The product is really very good as expected from a brand like Philips. But the most unfortunate thing is the struggle to find and buy the replacement heads. This is absolutely so unethical to trap consumers to buy such things and later charge them exorbitant price to get the much needed replacement heads. I regret buying it now as I am unable to find the replacement heads and the ones that are listed are way too higher than the cost of the whole product itself. It's so unfortunate that such reputed brand like Philips has also started playing these cheap trips on consumers. Please do check for the price and availability of the replacement heads if you plan to buy this or any other electrical toothbrush. Hope you don't get trapped like me.
2.0,November,2022,positive,USED THIS TOOTHPASTE FOR FEW DAYS AND NOTICED THE BLEEDING GUMS AFTER THAT I STOPPED USING IT. IF YOU WANT TO GO FOR ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSHES GO FOR THE ONE THAT HAVE ROUND BRUSH HEAD. IT'S BETTER THAN THIS KIND OF TOOTHBRUSH ALSO DON'T GO FOR PHILIPS SEE OTHER AVAILABLE OPTIONS AND GO FOR THEM. SAVE YOUR TEETHS
2.0,February,2023,negative,"The battery is not even lasting for 2 days after charging it properly for 3 hours. 6-8 minutes of use per day. Dissatisfied with Philips, a brand that I've always admired. I would like it replaced."
2.0,July,2022,neutral,"Every brush need to change its brush head every 3 months. So the head must be available in the market and at reasonable price. I have tried to find C1 type brush head on Amazon and elsewhere, but I can not get it. C2 type is available at exorbitant prices and there is no information available if it will fit the  Philips Sonicare Electric Toothbrush 1100 Series purchased by me. Hope Philips take care of these issues and also inform where to buy C1 brush heads or inform if C2 will fit ."
2.0,April,2023,negative,You won't enjoy brushing the way you enjoy using an ordinary brush.
2.0,March,2023,negative,"What's the use of product if it consumables parts are priced in multiples of original product, it's brush heads are very very costly"
1.0,September,2023,negative,Within 2 month brushhead change notification is coming.In just 2 month it’s taking more time to charge.Not worthy at all for such huge money
1.0,September,2023,negative,"I would say don’t ever buy this brush. I purchased it and once the brush head is worn out, the genuine Philips brush heads are 3 times the price of the brush. And very difficult to find one."
1.0,September,2023,positive,Quality is fine but within 6 months buttons damaged and brush heads too costly..
1.0,October,2023,negative,The power button stopped working after a year of use. Until now was working well
1.0,October,2023,negative,Stopped working within a week
1.0,April,2023,negative,"It’s not meant for  human mouth! It’s almost impossible to use the product without injuring your gums. The bristles are extremely hard and the vibration of the brush head is so fast that it will surely make your gums bleed. Please do buy this one, there are better options available. One of the worst products from Phillips.  If I could I would have given this product zero stars"
3.0,April,2022,positive,"After Day 10, my teeth got new life.Changes i can see. Thanks."

1.0,July,2023,negative,This just randomly started working all of a sudden on my toothbrush stand and after 1 min just stopped working all together. Disappointed in Phillips. This was my first ever toothbrush.
1.0,April,2023,negative,"It’s 12 days since I got the product. The battery is now completely discharged and cannot recharge.I have made attempts to recharge. For one hour, 3-5 hours and overnight. The battery charging light glows but the product doesn’t work.It’s now out of Amazon’s return window so I have to start chasing Philips now. I do not recommend the product"
1.0,July,2023,neutral,"Having charging issue from first day usage, always showing indication to charge and stopped working suddenly one one fine day morning, not getting charged."
1.0,May,2023,negative,Product is decent as it's from Phillips but becomes useless once it comes to replacement of the heads.It's difficult to find replacement heads and it's basically a scam to let people buy a product and then there's no after sales support on spare parts.
1.0,March,2023,neutral,No point buying this. Replacement heads mrp was 1000 for 2 heads but now a guy who imports from USA is selling at 5000 for 2. What's the point in getting an electric brush for 1000 rs for 3 months of usage.
1.0,June,2023,negative,Very poor battery backupIt took 5hrs to charge and run only for two use
1.0,April,2023,negative,"Product is nice, but brush heads aren't available! Don't buy it. Brush heads cost more than the product."
1.0,March,2023,positive,I liked sonicare so much better. regret buying this. battery isn’t lasting for more than 3days. sonicare used to last 15days! this costs more too!
1.0,March,2023,neutral,The vibrations will make you numb. And no idea if the bristles are replaceable. Avoid at all costs. Old 1 year stock with open box from below will be delivered.

1.0,April,2023,negative,Battery life is very poorIt hardly works 1 day
1.0,February,2023,positive,Although it's good to use. There are no replacement heads and the original ones that are available cost 5k or more.
1.0,January,2023,negative,I am disappointed with the brush design. It doesn't clean properly due to it's messy design. The brush designer should be hanged to death.
1.0,December,2022,positive,Brushing with a normal brush was more useful. Its irritating to feel a vibrator brush especially when ut touches teeth.

1.0,October,2022,negative,It just vibrates and of no useVibration causes more pain on any damaged toothCompletely useless

3.0,February,2023,negative,"This product runs well, I have been using it for some months now but the problem is after some time when u start your search for replacement heads there is nothing available. No official support so ended up buying may create brush heads and since it is not genuine the cleaning is of no use with those cheap heads attached. Please refrain from buying this."
3.0,May,2023,positive,Tooth brush is great. After 3 months you won't find the brush heads when you need to change the brush head
1.0,October,2023,negative,"Searched high & low, all Philips service centres, spoke to their customer care & what not, no replacement head available for this model, perhaps that's why it's cheap!!! Don't fall info this trap, after 6-8months you'll have to throw the brush away!"
1.0,April,2022,negative,Didn’t like the product at all - complete waste of money. Better options available in electric toothbrush vs this .
1.0,October,2022,negative,I bought this product from AMAZON within a month timer is not accurate at about 30 seconds so my suggestion is don't go for it.Sales & Marketing is very very worst they just want to make sales & make money.The quality team of Amazon is very bad.
,on,30,negative,">>>Philips Sonicare Electric Toothbrush 1100 Series with Sonic Technology, Up to 3x Plaque Removal, Easy Start Tech, QuadPacer, 2-minute Smart Timer. HX3641/11<<<Yeah, they 'forgot' to mention that unlike every other electric toothbrush I've ever owned it expects to use a USB port to charge. That's right, just like the one you don't have in your bathroom. Absolutely nowhere in the headline or the description does it mention this. False advertising."
