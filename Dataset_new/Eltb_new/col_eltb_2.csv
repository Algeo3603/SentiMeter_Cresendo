1.0,January,2024,positive,"I bought it in April 2023 and started using from October 2023. It did a good job, however it stopped working since December 2023. It used to stop intermittent evrry few seconds and one fine day it to totally stopped rotating."
3.0,March,2022,neutral,"I have been using this product since 8 December 2021, once a day. The two AAA alcaline batteries last just about 3 weeks for this once a day use; so, it is expensive to use this toothbrush. The product is just ok. As for the results, I didn't see any difference between this one and a non-electric toothbrush. I have two major problems: (i) I travel a lot in connection with my work but it is difficult to carry along this toothbrush because the manufacturer (Colgate) didn't think of including a storage case; the product just came in a paper carton; and (ii) I cannot find a replacement head for this particular toothbrush on Amazon.in or in other websites. Therefore, once the initial head becomes unusable, I am afraid, the entire toothbrush becomes useless. Colgate should have cautioned its customers appropriately."
3.0,March,2022,positive,"Product is authentic and works fine.Basic version of electric brush. Only one control which is the Power ON and OFFIf switched ON, will run for 2 minutes and automatically switches OFF.Does the basic cleaning but not efficient like regular manual brushing.I could feel some areas not properly cleaned, that too at the front visible teeth, after 2 X Brushings of 2 minsProduct package was slightly damaged, but not a big issue."
1.0,December,2023,positive,
3.0,June,2022,positive,More better option available in this price with the same functionality bettry got drain with in month if you used two time in a day for four-minutes
1.0,October,2023,negative,Bristles very rough and sharp. Can damage enamel and gums of elderly. Cant use . Waste of money.
2.0,January,2023,negative,"Brushes are very soft and don't clean properly . Brushes should have been harder , and vibration should have been stronger - similar to the Philips machines"
1.0,December,2022,negative,"It's vibration causes some inconvenience/pain in my sensitive teeth after brushing  and more than that,  it's  sound is very very  irritating ... I can confidently say  Oral B electronic brush is much more better than this.. I lost my total money paid as I can't take any risk when it comes to my teeth and I am not going to use this any more ( I used this for only one day)"
3.0,June,2021,neutral,There‚Äôs a simple brush strip that vibrates left to right. No circular motion or brush as I‚Äôve come to expect from powered toothbrushes. Disappointed.
1.0,July,2023,negative,It's was a part of a combo of the brush and the brush headsBut both are not compatibleVery bad
3.0,September,2021,neutral,Nothing special
1.0,August,2023,neutral,Not in working condition

1.0,July,2023,negative,"Not good, very soft for adult use"
2.0,September,2021,negative,The head is too big. The quality is very substandard and the fact that the brush head cannot be changed makes this a very useless and expensive buy. Do not buy
3.0,June,2020,neutral,"It is just like normal brush. Don't waste your money, instead buy any good normal brush."
3.0,May,2021,positive,Good
3.0,April,2021,positive,üëç
3.0,November,2020,negative,Does the job. Nothing great
1.0,January,2020,negative,This gadget was pretty useless as a toothbrush to begin with (as it only vibrates the bristles). After 2 weeks it stopped working altogether. It now switches-on on its own (gave us a pretty good scare when it started vibrating in the holder in the dead of the night) and never does switch on when I actually want to brush my teeth. Don't waste your money on this stupid useless thing masquerading as a power toothbrush.
1.0,June,2023,positive,Bad
3.0,September,2020,positive,good cleaner
2.0,November,2020,negative,It stopped working within 2 months. Not at all good to use. There's no warranty also. It's like buying a 1000 rupees brush for 2 months
3.0,November,2019,positive,Good but not up to the mark
1.0,July,2021,neutral,Please don't buy it as there is no warranty or guarantee on this product. When I contacted the Amazon Support they told me there is nothing which can be done now as it has been one month and the return window is closed.Please don't waste your hard earned money on this.
2.0,June,2021,negative,It has no box to save the bristle from dust and the head is not changeable

1.0,June,2022,negative,"Worst product packaging.Sensitive product like this should have sealed package.This one look like torned,used product.Shame!"
1.0,November,2021,negative,Not good until brushes move. It's just normal brush with attached motor so that it vibrate nothing more than that. Please don't buy and waste your time
1.0,October,2022,negative,Don't like..
1.0,February,2021,negative,Dont waste money. Its just a vibrating tooth brush which actually hurt your teeth. Bristles are too small. I would rather use simple tooth brush. Not happy with the product.
1.0,March,2021,negative,Worthless. I am still wondering why did I buy.Manual toothbrush is way too better.Movement of bristles is not good enough to clean teeths.
1.0,April,2022,negative,Not good. Plus stopped working within 15 days. Also no warranty.
1.0,March,2020,negative,Worst product by Colgate. Marketing gimmick. The brush only vibrates. The bristles when in contact with teeth stop vibrating and whole jaw feels vibrations. No brushing only vibration. Return is not possible otherwise I would opt for return.
1.0,July,2021,negative,Matter pending .. not yet resolved.All suggestions tried .. still not working
1.0,February,2021,negative,The toothbrush didn‚Äôt even last one month. The quality of the bristles is bad. Absolutely not worth it!
1.0,December,2019,negative,This product is listed as non returnable item... The product I have received is in non working condition so what you want me to do if I can't return it
1.0,April,2020,negative,Product was different from ordered. I will not go for any purchase from Amazon and use social media to publicise cheating under the garb of return policy.
1.0,March,2020,neutral,"Totally useless piece, it just vibrates, no oscillation or rotation like boasted in the description. I will suggest you buy a normal soft brush which will cost 20-30 rs."
1.0,March,2022,positive,The brush just vibrates.

3.0,November,2019,positive,"It took colgate 10 years to bring electric toothbrushes to india. So dont be too suprised this exists. Also dont expect some major change in using this toothbrush, once turned on it will only vibrate."
1.0,July,2022,neutral,In product description it is mentioned batteries included but inside box there are no batteries. Ther is no return option also.
1.0,December,2019,negative,I've always used a power toothbrush. Like oral b.  But this one is filled with issues.1. It's way too tiny. So there's not too much paste or even useful for the mouth.2. It's motor is more powerful than the requirement also. My gums start hitting after using this.3. After only 24 hours the brush stopped working and refused to turn on.
1.0,December,2019,positive,Bad
3.0,July,2021,negative,"Product is well designed but did not last even six months. Bought in Dec 2020 and it has developed circuit fault in June 2021. Brush comes on and off, in its storing place without anyone touching it."
1.0,November,2019,positive,Duplicate it is
1.0,November,2021,negative,Stopped working within 10 days .
