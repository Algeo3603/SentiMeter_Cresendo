1.0,November,2023,negative,"Absolute waste of money. Two weeks into using it and it already dies within seconds of using it, even after charging it multiple times. And it’s non returnable or exchangeable. So now I just have an enormous sized regular toothbrush with no electric feature. Go try perfora or another brand instead. This one is not worth a single rupee."
3.0,December,2023,positive,Easy to use don't have charging indicators.
3.0,October,2023,negative,Product damaged and packaging has benn opend received
3.0,September,2023,positive,"I was very happy with the product till the time it got discharged. Charging time is around 10 hrs, atleast give some indication that yes it is charging? Literally no indication at all I was under doubt if it is discharged or got damaged."
3.0,April,2023,positive,has only one mode unlike the latest product which is made in China but has 2 modes. this one is made in Hungary. Packaging is quite old - perhaps a product from the old batch. overall okay performance. Battery is a tad bit lower than the Made in China piece that i bought around the same time.modes should not matter too much though. overall good product.
2.0,November,2023,negative,The charge is not withstanding for hardly 1 week. Highly disappointed to find this.
1.0,February,2024,negative,Cannot use it more than twice even after full charge...and the product is non returnable too..!
1.0,January,2024,neutral,"This an 10year or more old model dont buy it.Buy with USB charging withvery high charged lifeAfter  using it for about 3 weeks, it is not wkg properly, issue with switch. I don't know whom to contact.Besides they have not given proper Manual .How to take care of it.It has only two modes!Many brands have 5/6 modes including slow modes.Before buying check out other brands available with 4/5 star rating s and more purchasers"
3.0,August,2023,positive,Batery life too short
3.0,August,2023,positive,
3.0,November,2020,negative,"This is my First time trying an electric Toothbrush and below are some pros and Cons:Pros:1)Looks really stylish2)You feel really fresh after brushing teeth with this3) Its head can go to even smallest areas of your mouth4) remove plaque better than the manual brush5) strong build qualityCons:1) No Cover which I feel is really unhygienic (you are paying 1500 bucks for that, they could include at least a small cover)2)In my opinion, the speed of the brush is a bit high, There should an adjustment button3) There’s No indicator if Your brush is Charging4) their 2 min timer doesn’t work5) the brush replacements are really expensiveEdit: my review after using this brush for over a monthBattery issuesYou need to charge this brush overnight otherwise it won’t workOverall an okay brush"
2.0,July,2023,negative,"I bought this thinking it will last me and I won't have to charge it very frequently. However, I've to charge is at least once a week. I brush twice a day. In addition, in the manual, they've declared the maximum duration of this product is 2 years. That is, the battery will reach end of its life in 2 years. This is something they should've declared clearly when making the sale. It cleans well, but I am disappointed with the battery."
3.0,July,2023,neutral,Brush everyday 2 times but doesn't clean
2.0,November,2020,negative,"This product is being introduced in indian market very late. Buying it is a gamble.Pros- Easy to use- Cleans the teeth way better than the manual wayCons- Manual suggests to keep it on charge always. Single charge takes ~16 hours. And stays for a week. Assuming brushing twice daily for 2 mins, that is mere 25 mins of backup.- No indicator when the battery is low, the brush just stops mid brushing. Gets difficult to track if you are traveling for long durations.- No indicator when put on charging. No usb charging support.- No protector for brush heads, feels unhygienic.- Brush heads are costly and often out of stock on Amazon.There are lot of reviews of people getting a defective product, and it is not returnable. Mine had battery issues from day one and stopped charging after one month of use. The service centers are very limited and getting the product repaired with them is a task in itself."
3.0,May,2023,negative,This brush clean teeth better than manual one. Just one drawback is to find the brushtop in market once original one get rough.
1.0,January,2024,negative,Been less than 2 months and i m not able to charge it. Can smone suggest how to handle this issue
1.0,February,2024,negative,Charger not working..useless product
1.0,November,2023,negative,"Very hard on gums, has a very chunky feeling in the mouth .. speed of rotation is quiet slow and worst is the battery life of only couple of days before recharge .. actually there is no indication on the brush that it's even charging when kept on pod forget indication of fully charged .. no value for money"
1.0,January,2024,negative,It’s not working anymoreI dunno why
2.0,July,2023,negative,When I unpack the box and read the guidelines and found the some accessories are missing. Dishwashersafe (E) and Travel cas (F) both are missing in this box.
2.0,April,2023,positive,"I bought the ""brush + refill"" option, and the replacement brush heads are apparently for another variant and don't even fit this brush???? Then why is it even an option?? Please don't put up useless options for customers - we can't even return it. What do I do with the extra brush heads now?? -_-PS: brush is ok. Only 1 mode tho"
1.0,August,2023,positive,"1: It was a really good brush for 3-4 days it cleaned my teeth quite good and was working like a charm2: Now this is where it all started the problem was this IS NOT AT ALL CHARGING  i put it on charge for 3 days .....like wth it stopped working after that Amazon has a 5 days return policy but I don't blame them....this product is like seeing food vloggers which is good on the outside for 2 -3 but after that it just stops and gives you bs 🤣....wasted my ₹1210 after applying a god coupon of 50 rupees 🤣.....don't buy it,it is kinda useless buy then i08 the expensive one and be happy because this is something else which don't want to experience again 😅😅.....well kudos to the people who have used it for 2-3 months and then stops"
3.0,January,2023,negative,"This product is manufactured in China. I bought it, and the website has deliberately mentioned - Country of Origin- India. They should be punished."
2.0,December,2022,negative,I have been using since 12 days now but since the beginning the battery life is the worst. I tried charging it for 30mins & battery gets over not even half way to 2 minutes & when j charge it for more than 1 hour than only it stays for a whole 2 minutes & in the next usage it again drains out within 1 minute of usage. It's been this way since the start so I have to keep my regular toothbrush on hand to use if this one stops midway. Cleaning wise its good. But purchase it if you can keep it always on charging.
3.0,January,2023,negative,The charging stopped suddenly after use of 5 months.Need charger to be replaced
3.0,April,2023,positive,Too expensive
1.0,November,2023,neutral,It is not getting charged.  Product has become totally useless.  I noticed this before close of return window (26 October).  I couldn't get back as I was travelling.  Now I leave it to your good sense.
1.0,October,2023,negative,The purpose of brushing is not fully functionalIt doesn’t make you feel fresh and the feel of brushing is not at all there. The whole time you are worried about the liquid coming out from your mouth and the foaming is not at all Upto the mark..zero rating is not avl so I couldn’t give
1.0,December,2023,negative,Not able to charge the brush. Following all the instructions to charge the brush but still not able to charge the same.
1.0,November,2023,negative,The product stopped working within a month of purchase. Waste of money. Did not expect substandard product from Oral-B
1.0,December,2023,neutral,Only lasted 2 months stopped working don't buy
1.0,October,2023,negative,"The product has stopped working within 1.5 months of being delivered.At first I thought it might have discharged but even after charging it for full 24 Hrs,it didn't work.Highly disappointed with the brand!Also I am not getting the ways to claim for warranty."
2.0,June,2021,negative,"This product is being introduced in indian market very late.

1.0,October,2023,negative,Product is not working .but I have contacted Amazon service regarding replacement the item they are not responding properly and they don’t help me.this is worrest service of Amazon and product .guys don’t buy this items
1.0,June,2022,negative,"I have been using the product for a month now, and god it's awful!There are no indicators on when the battery life starts to get low. So every 4-5 days, the battery life will run out WHILE you are brushing your teeth, with all the foam in your mouth wondering what the hell exactly happened, scampering to find your old manual toothbrush to finish brushing for that day.And there are no indicators when you place the brush for charging, so you better pray to god almighty that it DID start charging, because more often than not, it won't, and when you pick up the brush the next day, still zero battery, so you adjust the brush and the charger a little bit and hope that it started charging THIS TIME, and so on.When you do find some luck and manage to charge your brush, it does a decent job and the 30 second timer ensure you don't over or under brushIt's unbelievable how such a shitty product has a 4+ rating on amazon, and how hard it is for Oral B to discontinue this and start a better model with some battery indicators. Feel like throwing this in the dustbin every other day and buying a better version. What a waste of moneySigh :("
3.0,March,2022,negative,Battery backup is only for 3-4 days &It should at least 1 brush head free with this price band.And its power button quality is also not good as expected And about freshness I will give 4.5 score out of 5
3.0,November,2021,positive,One thing I am disappointed from this is it's battery backup. It runs only 10- 12 minutes. Now depends how you use it. I like if it has more backup. Other wise very good product. It cleans my teeth completely which normal toothbrush can't do.
1.0,October,2023,neutral,Not even been 2 months and the brush has stopped charging. Like even after charging for entire day it dosent last even for 30 seconds ok total. Not even getting any help from customer service. Do not buy.
1.0,October,2023,neutral,"It’s not even been 2 months and the product stopped working, even after charging for a 5-6 hours, it works for only 30 seconds. Trying to get in touch with customer care but no luck. Please help"
3.0,May,2022,positive,
3.0,July,2021,neutral,There is no charge indicator on the brush. Also no battery status indicator. So you have no means of knowing whether the brush is actually getting charged when plugged in. Also no way to see how much battery is left. The cord that comes with the charging station is very short.
1.0,November,2023,negative,"Stopped working in. 15days..,all the literature is in Chinese ...do not know whom to complaint..."
3.0,September,2020,neutral,For brushing my teeth. It is not to my expectations When the handle is on the charger there is no indication to show it is charging or not. That is  the handle is not having a charge indicator as the one I was using earlier handle type(4729”) I contacted the costumer  care  twice but I didn’t get satisfactory answer
1.0,November,2023,negative,Stopped working in a couple of days
1.0,December,2023,positive,
1.0,September,2023,negative,"Bad design- the area where the steel rod vibrates, has a gap which causes the tooth paste and other things from the brush to seep in which you can’t clean and it smells. Battery goes after 1.5 years and needs daily charging"
1.0,September,2023,negative,"Horrible product, it stopped working after 2 days and Amazon is not replacing it. They cheated us...very bad experience, dnt buy...trust me. 1400rs wasted. I want to give 0 Star"
1.0,July,2023,negative,"I am a tech savvy person and I don't give up on my electronics. But this thing worked only for a week and it completely stopped charging. It is useless now. I have tried everything, but no use.Please put your money somewhere else, these guys don't deserve even 1 star ."
3.0,January,2022,positive,"The toothbrush was working fine. I bought it in August 2021. In January 2022, i charge it for the appropriate time, but it gets discharged in 3-4 days."
3.0,April,2022,negative,"1. the vibration is weak even then full charged.2. if i don't keep charging it, the vibration is weaker without use."

1.0,September,2023,neutral,"Don't buy this product, battery life is 15 days for which I purchased,  not charging , no response from customer support,  wrist product and very expensive.Don't recommend"
1.0,March,2023,positive,I PURCHASED THREE TOOTHBRUSHES WITHIN A SPAN OF A WEEK. BATTERY BACK UP IS UNSATISFACTORY IN ALL THE THREE. I LODGED A GRIEVANCE FOR ONE 10 DAYS AGO. P & G IS STILL ASKING QUESTIONS AND SEEKING COPIES OF THE INVOICE AND ALSO PICTURES OF THE PRODUCT WHICH I HAVE ALREADY SENT THROUGH E-MAIL & WHATSAPP. STILL NO REMEDIAL ACTION TAKEN. P & G DOESN'T SEEM TO BE WORRIED ABOUT ITS OWN REPUTATION.PRODUCT WITH A VERY POOR/ IRRITATING BATTERY AND POOR CUSTOMER CARE.DON'T BUY.
1.0,October,2023,negative,Stopped working exactly after a month. Please don't prefer this product
2.0,December,2021,negative,I liked it a lot initially but got bored with it after using for a few months and went back to a regular brush. I guess one of the reason was how quickly it would get discharged and needed to be recharged and also the speed of the motor would slow down gradually after a full charge so there was no consistency in its performance which was a little dissapointing. But I did use it for more than 6 months so I guess I got my money's worth.
2.0,March,2023,positive,Product is good but Battery is not charging after 3 months of use
2.0,April,2023,negative,Not working now.Product not value for money
1.0,October,2023,negative,Even after charging it the problem is there
2.0,April,2022,positive,I bought this brush on 9th Nov & it is a very powerful brush. Worked really well till mid march. The battery ran out so as always put it on charge. Tried to use the brush after the charge was complete & it just wouldn't power on. Tried a few times but no luck. Kindly adviceon how to get it fixed as it has 2 yrs warranty!Thank you
2.0,May,2021,negative,"This brush does a great job of brushing. U can see the difference from first use. The biggest problem is battery charger. They recommend 16 hours of charging and u will have no idea whether it’s getting charged or not since u don’t have any light or indicator to know the battery. Secondly you should make sure u charge this before it gets drained completely. If u r using it and it gets drained out, u can’t charge it as it keeps getting discharged automatically since it’s in ‘on’ state. Less than 1 month of usage and I am already looking for service centres during lockdown period as the brush stopped working due to some charging issue"
3.0,September,2021,positive,The brush is quite good and does the job right but given the price segment a battery indicator should be included. Overall the product is nice and it's waterproof
1.0,September,2023,negative,"This is the worst product I ever buy, battery life is just 2-3 days and it stop.working after 3 months only."
1.0,May,2023,negative,Bought this product thinking Oral B being a global brand would make atleast an average product. But this is worse than that. Rotating brush head movements are violent and hurt your teeth and gums.I have bleeding gums because of this bad product.The mentioned features like 2 minutes timer and sensitive mode doesn't work at all.Absolutely hate it. 900 bucks down the drain.
3.0,August,2021,positive,Brushing teeth obviously. It is a good product but does not have a plugged-in or a fully - charged indicating light Which I feel is a must for all gadgets.
3.0,August,2022,negative,Afrer 6months getting no use
1.0,January,2023,negative,"Writting this review after 2 months of use. Brush worked fine for couple of uses when I bought it. But then when it's battery died I came to know about its wonderful feature- it's NON-EXISTENT BATTERY. When you charge it there is absolutely no way to know whether it's charging or not. Charge it for 1 hour and it's good for 1 use which lasts for hardly 2 mins. No wonder why they haven't given indicator, otherwise people would come to know about its horrible battery.Bought it even after reading similar issue in the comments, now regretting my decision. Money down the drain."
3.0,August,2022,neutral,Don't have a charging indicator :(
3.0,March,2021,positive,The brush is excellent at what it's supposed to do but like everyone was saying there could be an indicator to mention the charging and travel case would be the minimum thing one would expect after paying such premium price.
1.0,April,2023,negative,"The toothbrush was manufactured in 2021 and was over 15 months old when I received it, and it stopped working only after 4 days of use. Do not order from, ""Electronics Bazaar Store""; this is the worst seller on Amazon for knowingly sending old and bound to be defective products on Amazon. Seek other sellers instead, where chances would be that your product lasts longer."
3.0,May,2021,positive,Brush is good but please spend little bit on plugs 3 pin plug dena ma kya problem hDubara charge kasa karu ye bata do  ma hindustan se hu .
2.0,December,2022,negative,Was  excellent article and bring Braun make was confident of the quality. Till it stopped working and just refuses to respond..Been just three months ....very dissappointed
1.0,October,2023,positive,Stopped Working in one month
1.0,March,2021,negative,"I bought this toothbrush in January 2021 and few days back even after putting it on charge for whole night it was not working. So I thought may be some issue in the plug, therefore I kept it on different plugs multiple times for around 10 to 16 hrs each time but still it wasn't working. As they mentioned in the discription there is a warranty of 1 year, I tried calling customer care and I was on the line for more then 30minutes and no one picked my call. I've been buying products from Amazon from more than 5 years but for the first time I'm highly disappointed by the product I received through Amazon. I bought this product after seeing so many good reviews and I'm writing this comment to share my experience with this product, which is really really worst. I would suggest don't buy this toothbrush, it's a total wastage of money."
3.0,September,2021,negative,Unable to understand whether or not it's charging. At least an indicator that the charger is plugged and charging is on is required.
1.0,July,2023,negative,I brought this electric toothbrush and a kids Spider-Man electric toothbrush and I have had to send both back to P&G as they both stopped working after 3 months!P&G have since replaced them and confirmed they were both faulty.
1.0,April,2023,negative,"Used it only for 3 days and it stopped working. spoke with a customer service rep about this but no one bothered to respond back even if the product is faulty. This kind of treatment to a long standing and valuable customer who orders lot of things, isn't right. You've lost a good customer"
1.0,September,2023,neutral,It has no charging indicator.Charging Lasts Only three days. Will not recommend
3.0,May,2022,neutral,Battery life not upto mark
1.0,April,2023,negative,"Charger not working, there is no charging indication on the toothbrush or the charger. The device battery comes with some charge out of the box. Once the battery got over it was more than the return window (5 days). On the 6th day I was denied the replacement despite the acknowledgement of a defective product.Help!"
1.0,August,2023,negative,"As per my personal experiment l, its not worth for the money instead we could brush by normal BRUSH"
1.0,August,2023,neutral,Stopped working within a week. Not charging at allGot charged just once and worked for a week. Stopped charging from the second time onwards
1.0,September,2023,negative,"It has stopped working completely, i could never charge it even once. useless product refrain from buying"
1.0,August,2023,neutral,This does not have any battery indication which makes it very hard to charge. Only buy the varient with battery indication.
1.0,May,2022,negative,"I bought this toothbrush for my mother as gift. When it came there was some battery in it so it worked few days. My mother is old and does not understand things technically that much. When it discharged , she put it on charging but it never charges . It never worked again. There is no LED indicator in this brush as generally what I have seen in UK sold toothbrushes. So an user can never understand that it is even charging or not. When I called Amazon regarding this faulty brush , they simply said NO to take the product back and just my INR1200 lost in fraud. Avoid this toothbrush. Its not worth money."
3.0,March,2021,positive,Battery charging no indication. Brush stop brushing then only charging is over can be understood. This is the only drwaback. Blue and Black color are good.  Stand is good .
1.0,July,2021,negative,"USELESS PRODUCT.I bought this toothbrush in June 2021 and after two days even after putting it on charge for whole night it was not working. So I thought may be some issue in the plug, therefore I kept it on different plugs multiple times for around 10 to 16 hrs each time but still it wasn't working. As they mentioned in the discription there is a warranty of 1 year, I tried calling customer care I was told that the product is not return/exchangeable. I've been buying products from Amazon from more than 5 years but for the first time I'm highly disappointed by the product I received through Amazon as well the customer service. It seems that These people do not bother for the customer reviews anymore. I bought this product after seeing so many good reviews and I'm writing this comment to share my experience with this product, which is really really worst. I would suggest don't buy this toothbrush, it's a total wastage of money."
1.0,April,2023,negative,"Stopped working after one use, kept it in charge for a whole day , still doesn’t work. Had bought it with the extra refill pack which was given in the option but the refills were for different toothbrush. Moreover, we can’t return it. Stop fooling the customers!!!!!!!!"
1.0,May,2023,negative,"No way to know if it is charging or not. No way to know why it refuses to switch on after even a week of continuous charging, just 6 months into its use.Money wasted. Should have gone in for a more expensive one like Philips."
3.0,January,2021,negative,Unpacking surprise disappointed to see for such a big brand they skimped on a simple charging light. i will not know there is any issue or not unless it dies on me.
3.0,October,2020,negative,"Satisfied with the product. If it completely discharges, you need to charge it overnight (16 hrs) for it to work properly. However, the replacement brush heads are too expensive. They shouldn't cost as much as the original unit."
3.0,March,2022,positive,Kindly improve Battery life else reduce product cost..
