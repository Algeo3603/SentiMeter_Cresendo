3.0,August,2023,positive,Purchased on october 25. This was my electric toothbrush. Had a good experience but stopped working after 9 months only.
1.0,January,2024,positive,"Read the review if you want to know how the product is but the one star is because you need to send them a proof of review for the company to register warranty.It's been 2 days and the for 700+ ruppes you can't ask for more.Colour is beautiful, product feels sturdy and premium enough.Comes with a cheap dc 5v usb charger but atleast it's usb. For this price range you can't ask for more.Only ick is if they had a plug for the charger hole (image 3) so that water dosent seep inside. Vibration dosent feel strong as 1.5k ones but for this price range this is the best you're gonna get. Vs the spark one id say this is better in quality but for vibrations spark one is slightly better"

1.0,August,2023,negative,Stopped charging after some time
1.0,January,2022,negative,I bought 2 of these 3 months ago. One of them is working fine so far. The other one has bad battery. It drained after 2 uses. Even after overnight charging the brush head doesn't vibrate at all. It just makes sound. It is faulty and not able to use. Unfortunately I can't return used product. So beware 50 percent chance that it works.
1.0,November,2021,negative,"For 3 weeks, it was working fine. Suddenly it stopped working. I raised a complaint on their website but no response. I also tried calling their toll-free number and it is invalid. I'm not happy with the product and their customer service."

1.0,December,2022,negative,battery is gone
1.0,December,2022,negative,Disappointed with the electric toothbrush as it stopped functioning after 15 months of use.The product comes with 1 year warranty while Oral-B provides 2-year warranty on their products.Refrain from buying this if you are not looking for disappointment and feeling cheated. I purchased the product from cred and not amazon.
1.0,August,2021,negative,Bad don’t buy it use agaro electric toothbrush this is not worth for the money don’t buy don’t buy there are better options.
