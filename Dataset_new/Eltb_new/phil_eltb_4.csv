1.0,October,2022,negative,"Update:I bought this brush is Oct-22 and after few months the brush head was worn out and I tried to buy a replacement head. To my shock, they don't exist and even if they did they cost about 4500Rs for a pair. I would never ever buy a philips brush again. They lure us in with low brush price, but later steal money with high replacement brush head cost.This is just an electric brush just for namesake. I have used electric brushes before and their motors are powerful enough to clean the teeth and remove the plaque. But on this one, it's way too underpowered because of 1.5V batteries. You won't feel like you're using electric brush. If you don't add manual movements, your teeth won't be cleaned. I was fooled by the reviews and paid 1k for this junk. Just don't buy. Buy any regular electric toothbrushes except this one, they have larger batteries and deliver power well for cleaning teeth."
3.0,October,2023,negative,"I have been using Philips Sonicare product from 2004...most of the brushes survive for 18-24 months...finally, tried this new product hoping this can be useful instead of the expensive short lasting products... but the brash head and the oscillating frequency is not good...disappointed..."
3.0,November,2023,positive,Quality
3.0,August,2023,neutral,Travel case is not included in the package. It should have been mentioned clearly.
3.0,March,2023,negative,It’s  a great dental care product however NON Availability of the replacement heads makes it redundant after 3 months.Bought 3 different sets of replacement heads from Amazone which claims that all are compatible with this product but none fits with this one .
3.0,November,2022,neutral,"Nothing great about this toothbrush except that it runs on battery,  which is a big plus for me but some may prefer the rechargeable type . As a toothbrush it has very cheap quality bristles and the power is just average and you will have to add some manual effort to achieve the results . That is expected from a battery powered toothbrush."
3.0,April,2023,negative,"Good to use, but replacement brushing head very costly, not worth buying"
3.0,December,2022,negative,"As a person with sensitive teeth , the bristle of the brush are way too hard for it to be usable . I wish they had softer bristle heads ."
3.0,October,2022,negative,Its shown that the brush head moves up and down but the there are only micro vibrations happening in the brush. Overall the brush material seems durable and the design is sleek. Depends on personal. Choice I would rate it as an average product
1.0,June,2023,negative,"I purchased this brush three months ago, and initially, I was quite pleased with it. However, after a few weeks, I noticed that the bristles on the brush head started to weaken. Unfortunately, I struggled to find any suitable replacements for it. Even when I did manage to locate some, they were priced at three times the cost of the brush itself. It's incredibly disappointing, Philips. I strongly advise against purchasing it."
1.0,July,2023,negative,It is not comfortable for me to see that package is opened & sent without seal . When I use a personal care product I want to be assured that it is not tampered with. As the product is working fine I am not returning this item . But I’m not happy with the state it was delivered in
2.0,March,2023,negative,Avoid this as you'll have a hard time finding it's replacement brush heads. They're just way too expensive.
1.0,March,2023,negative,"This product could have been a decent electric toothbrush. However, its simply impossible to buy replacement heads. Only options available online are imported ones which cost more than this tooth brush itself!There are enough questions on Amazon inquiring for replacement heads, however Philips and its sellers are least bothered.Deserves not more than one star for creating a single use product"
1.0,November,2022,negative,"I replaced this toothbrush with my one year old oral b electric brush and found out that philips does not provide you with after sales for the brush although the brush itself is great there's no replacement heads out there for it and the one's available for it are imported so they cost more than the toothbrush itself, in short paisa barbaad mat karo go for oral b."
1.0,June,2023,negative,Using this has led to more sensitivity issues in my tooth cap. I may have to visit a dentist now. PLEASE  DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT IF YOU ALREADY HAVE UNDERWENT RCT BEFORE.
1.0,June,2023,positive,You buy it as use and throw since Philips is very smart and doesn't supply replacement heads anywhere you need to buy whole device again
1.0,March,2023,neutral,"There is no quality and not working properly and doesn't have support properly even we don't have to chat option, I don't recommend this Product to buy anyone. .....no return/refund policy also I think 😌bcoz I submitted but no response from their end"
1.0,June,2023,positive,"No replacement head, one listed on Amazon is very highly priced 4000 rs. But it if you can afford this"
1.0,April,2023,positive,"Product price is around 1,000 but replacement heads are sold at 5,000? Is this a scam . Product is good but without replacement heads this becomes use and throw product. Total let down by phillips"
1.0,May,2023,negative,It’s quite difficult to find a new head once the one came with the package worn out. So it’s kind of one time use.
1.0,March,2023,negative,Brush heads are difficult to find or not available and the available ones are very expensive. Better to stick with brands that stock brush heads frequently and promptly.
1.0,February,2023,negative,Overpriced and does not really help.. vibration is too strong for the back of the teeth.Not sure why Philips made this product. Terrible
1.0,March,2023,negative,Its a trap...dont fall for it
1.0,February,2023,neutral,Toothbrush is not working. Tried to contact Amazon but no response from them.
1.0,April,2023,positive,I need to throw this
1.0,November,2022,neutral,"Pathetic quality, it doesn't even feel any different than a normal brush."
3.0,May,2023,negative,Brush works fine .automatically switch off after 2 minutesThe bristles are hard an feel painful while brushing battery lastsValue for money
3.0,April,2023,positive,"Vibration is average, need to apply manual pressure. Finding the brush replacements is a hard task. Recommended only for beginners."
2.0,July,2023,positive,"Brush is really good, but can't find the replaceable heads, so buying it is not much worthy. Battery backup is amazing."
2.0,March,2023,negative,"When you look at the pricing of 899 or below it does look tempting to grab it without giving a second thought.JUST STOP.The Brush:No doubt its good,it has changed my brushing habits.The Nightmare:Replacement heads are not officially or unofficially available. Even if they are made available by philips the pricing will be more than the cost of the tooth brush for 3 heads,just search it up on Amazon US store and see the pricing. When that happens you will be trying to dump this toothbrush away because at that pricing this toothbrush stops making any sense.That being said I have tried some third-party brush heads that I ordered online but none of them fit.My Advice:STAY AWAY FROM THIS. If you do want a philips toothbrush just search up the model number of the toothbrush and first check if the replacement heads are readily available, and then get locked away into the ecosystem."
1.0,May,2023,negative,It is a normal brush which only vibrates and doesn’t move right left as shown in the video in the images.. and is it non returnable.Very disappointing..Hence useless even the Brussels are super soft and the the brussels bed is very small
1.0,April,2023,neutral,"Not value for money, waste of money.Its good to have normal brushPlease don’t waste your hard earned money here"
1.0,February,2023,negative,Travel case is missing in the box. It's look like used product. And i can't return it. Waste of money.
3.0,October,2022,positive,"I used an electric brush for the first time and this brush is best from the price point as well as a trusted brand name. It vibrates so you don't need to apply too much pressure on your teeth while brushing. It cleanse the teeth well though I do not use it for whole 2 minutes. There's an easy On-off button. Will update about its battery life after using it for sometime.Update:After using it for more than a month, the bristles have spread like a flower. I gave this to my son as the size of brush head is small as compared to regular adult brushes available in market. Battery is working fine."
,January,2024,negative,Positive - compact and stylish - great for travel. Negatives - the quality of the vibrations are very weak - I can't see this toothbrush offering a deep clean like its more robust cousins. Barely - if at all - better than a regular non-powered toothbrush.
,on,7,positive,All my other Philips one electric toothbrushes came with a case for travel but this one didn’t. Otherwise love it
,on,30,neutral,"the package had been opened, there was no case, and the battery had already been installedseemed like a previously returned item was shipped to me"
,on,17,negative,missing item inside
,on,30,negative,Opened packaging ... missing travel case.
,on,20,neutral,The charger does not fit the brush
,on,12,neutral,"I bought this so I wouldn't have to drag my chargeable toothbrush around when house/farm sitting.  But the battery is a single AAA and it doesn't give a very powerful brushing.  My teeth did not feel very clean when it finished its cycle.  I did not send it back, but I couldn't give it more than 3 stars - it's quite handy and I love the case - very packable.  Just not powerful enough even with a new battery.  I finally gave up and just used it as a regular brush."
,on,7,negative,"First, the head of this brush is way too small in my opinion. I feel like I have to spend extra time to get a feeling of cleanliness. Therefore, I don’t like that it turns off on its own after like a minute I think. Since the head is so small, I have to turn it back on and continue to brush. I have to do this at least three times and that’s when I finally feel like my teeth have been cleaned properly. I don’t feel like it works well on your tongue neither. I do like it, it is soft on your teeth but again, too small of a brush, too soft bristles and turns off too quickly."
,December,2023,negative,"The rounded bottom prevents you from standing it upright and the case design is ackward and confusing. It's a decent toothbrush, but the Colgate competitor has a better product design."
,on,20,positive,The reviews are accurate. It’s a regular toothbrush with a soft vibration. Still have to brush like normal. I have an electric toothbrush I got from a dollar store that scrubs harder with less effort. It’s ok… The thing I like most is the color and the timer helps me keep track of time when I’m rushing in the morning.
,on,12,positive,"When I first found this product, I was a static and thought this was going to be great, because my current electrical toothbrush that I use at home the traveling case is kind of bulky. However, when I got this in the mail and opened it and didn’t even use it but just put the vibration on it was like nothing and I would’ve still had to manually brush my teeth because the vibration was not strong enough so unfortunately I had to return."
,on,24,positive,This is the cutest tooth brush. Beware it has a small brush head but it’s super powerful!
,February,2024,negative,"Brush works great, but the battery died less than one month in. Very disappointed as it claims they last up to three months."
,on,9,positive,This is great for travel as its compact and easy to store in a small bag. However the bristles on the brush are very soft and the 30 second “notification” when brushing is very weak. I miss the “signal” just about every time. Love the fun colors through.
,January,2024,negative,It’s like really soft the BristolFeels weird but I also like firmer brushes
,on,25,neutral,I've been liking this toothbrush except that I've had to swap the battery out twice in the last 6 month. I used rechargeable AAA to make this not so bad environmentally and was just going to deal with swapping the batteries out and charging them more often but this latest battery change did not fix the problem of the brush not staying on for more than 5 seconds.
,on,11,negative,"I got the battery version (not rechargeable). I was hoping it would work like my regular bigger Sonicare brush at home, but the vibration is a lot weaker - so much weaker that it adds nothing to cleaning power and I have to use it like a regular brush. What’s the point?One easy way to compare the power is to turn the brush on and wet the brush head; my home  Sonicare splatters tiny droplets everywhere, but anything near this little brush stays perfectly dry.The best battery toothbrush I’ve used is still my Oral-B with the rotating head that uses 2 AAs; it cleans just about as well as my home Sonicare. It’s not a small or as cute but at least it actually works!"
,on,22,neutral,It’s fine and quiet but not much power in the brushing action
,on,16,positive,I thought it would be a little better
,on,26,positive,Bought it because it’s compact for traveling.
,on,10,positive,"For the price, this is a pretty decent toothbrush. Has a 2 minute timer function that is nice, along with a pressure sensor (so that you don't accidentally brush with too much force). Only down side is that it vibrates side to side, versus being circular rotation (which was recommended to me by my dentist). However, I still feel that it cleans my teeth well, and the color choice are really pretty."
,on,5,negative,"This is the second one I have had. The switch failed on the first one and I wrote it off as a fluke. However, the second one I purchased is doing the same thing. It gets more and more difficult to turn on until it quits working altogether. I'm not sure if water is getting into the mechanism or what but it is a design flaw."
,on,9,negative,Bought this in June.  It was in my spare bathroom and didn’t get used very often.  Used it today and could not get it to shut off even after two minutes.  The only way to get it to shut off was to disconnect from battery.  This isn’t the first time it wouldn’t shut of but was eventually able to get it shut off.  Ended up throwing it as I refuse to fight with it
,July,2023,negative,Product as described and arrived on time. Low power with mild vibration only. Know you are not getting your standard power toothbrush. Meant for small and light for travel. Not sure it will clean better than standard toothbrush. Time will tell.
,on,8,positive,"If you are looking for a powerful travel electric tooth brush to supplement your Philips at home, skip this one. The vibration is nice but it’s just a vibration-nothing strong enough to move plaque away from the teeth. You do not walk away with dental cleaning kinda of clean.I will say that the brush has a nice form factor. Has a nice weight and the cover is nice. It’s a bit “heavy” but this is coming from a backpacker who likes her gear to be very lightweight. Otherwise the weight is a nonissue.I’ll continue to use it but if you are struggling with purchasing this, read the reviews carefully. The price point isn’t terrible but this brush isn’t the greatest."
,on,25,positive,Ok for the price. Good for a travel toothbrush still not as good as a full electric/ rechargeable toothbrush.
,on,28,negative,I bought this thing about 2 years ago. Now I am here to leave a review bc it’s broken. This toothbrush is not a good electric toothbrush. The brush head is poorly designed and not good for keeping teeth clean. I had an oral b electric toothbrush before and now I am switching back to that one. I regret I used this thing for so long.
,on,19,positive,"Was excited about this brush and I will say that it is a nice size for traveling but personally the vibration is very low and not as powerful as a regular large size phillips brush, Probably because its battery operated? I just felt it didn’t give me the same cleaning power (which I was hoping for so I didn’t have to carry around my full size all the time)Maybe if they rework the battery it can be the same power as a full size"
,on,22,positive,"Work with battery, so easy to get all over the world without taking the charger.But not that powerful as regular sonicare one"
,on,30,negative,"Muy suave, siento que no limpia bien"
,on,12,positive,"It's just vibrates I humm along lol,  and case is nice. Thank you."
,June,2022,negative,"Cute brush, compact, great for travel. Unfortunately the packaging is a plastic blister sandwiched between two sheets if glued-on cardboard. The entire thing cannot be recycled. Had I known this I would have reconsidered buying this brush.Update 12/16/22: Lowering the rating on this for two reasons: 1) it's impossible to find replacement brush heads for this, the normal ones don't fit and 2) ordered another whole new brush just to get a new head (what a waste of electronic recycling) and upon selecting a ""2 count (pack of 1)"" product option received just one toothbrush. The ""2 count"" product option is false advertisement, since it's not a 2 count."
,on,4,negative,"I really liked this toothbrush and the case it comes in, my son has one similar in a different color I bought for him at Kohl’s. This one I ordered from Amazon has quit, even though I’ve changed out with brand new batteries twice trying to get it to work it still does not work! Very disappointed."
,October,2022,positive,Its okay .. just vibrates
,December,2023,negative,"It’s supposed come with AAA battery, instructions with no battery in the package, very disappointed."
,on,27,positive,I assumed because it has Sonicare in the name that this is ultrasonic brush like all other Sonicare products which I use and love because they clean much better than any other type of brush.  It is not ultrasonic.  So it doesn't clean nearly as well as a real Sonicare brush.  This one cleans barely any better than a manual brush.  Not with the money.
,on,8,negative,My teeth never felt as clean as they do with a stronger toothbrush.  Have to replace it because I just don't like it.
,on,19,positive,"I got this to keep in my travel bag.  I like the compact design, the one-piece travel case, the long battery life (with AAA batteries and no need to take a charger along).  The performance is just ""meh"" compared to my real sonicare that I use at home.  For $15 it makes sense that it's not going to compare to it's big brother model, but my teeth don't get as smooth and clean with it.  I'm happy enough with it but it's not noticeably better than manual brushing."
,on,26,negative,Don't expect a real Sonicare.  I 'll carry it in my travel bag until the batteries die then it goes in the trash.  I still brush like I do with a regular toothbrush.
,on,30,negative,Quality not very good
,on,4,negative,"The photograph for this item clearly shows that it comes with a travel case. However, the toothbrush that I received did not come with a travel case. Will be returning."
,September,2022,neutral,Brought it for 2 weeks travelling and the bristles are too soft it did not get the gunk from in between my teeth. Hard to brush harder than normal. I like the design/case and its light but I will be taking my other toothbrush
,on,29,negative,"This toothbrush is weak. It’s not worth buying. Get the regular one, charge it before you travel."
,December,2022,negative,If you're like me and are used to using a Phillips Soniccare Brush or the like- you'll be hugely disappointed by this brush. The brush head vibrates a tiny bit but this is a MANUAL toothbrush. We bought these to replace our Phillips but didn't like them at all. They'll be used as travel toothbrushes and that's it. Not a good enough clean for us to use daily. The travel cases and funky colours are nice but they don't make up for the lack of cleaning power.
,on,12,positive,Small head n short handle!
,September,2023,negative,It really has very little oomph.  It really just buzzes rather than vibrate like a regular electric toothbrush.
,on,24,positive,"Purchased in May. It’s now November and the unit doesn’t function. Battery is good, but nothing happens when I press the on/off button. I liked it until it broke."
,on,15,positive,"If I had it to do over, I’d buy my regular SonicCare. This one does the job but it’s more like a normal toothbrush that slightly vibrates rather than having the real sonic experience. You have to use it like a normal toothbrush with the vibration adding, maybe, some extra cleaning. Guess I’m spoiled to my full SonicCare. The nice thing is it is smaller and super portable. I take it when traveling."
,July,2022,negative,"I am not sure if mine is broken or what, but it just hums, there is no discernable motion like my regular one, Skip this one, just take your full size in a baggie and move on. It's cute but useless."
,on,9,negative,Good quality but not great.  I expected it to work better for the price
,on,17,neutral,Head is kind of small and I don’t feel like I can brush as hard as I need to due to the bristles being less sturdy
,on,4,negative,"I have owned several battery operated toothbrushes but this is the worst, the battery only last a week"
,on,23,negative,"I was hoping this would replace my Philips Sonicare Healthywhite I have used for 10 year while traveling. MISTAKE. Everything functional about it is disappointing and doesn't justify the price.The brush is too soft, the vibration is mild and doesn't offer extra cleaning. The casing picked up ink from packaging of my other toiletries in my toiletry bag so it already looked old on arrival. I would be better off using the disposable toothbrush offered by the airline or packing the 5-to-a-pack dollar-store toothbrushes I keep around for guests. Stay away - you will NOT find the Philips tooth health quality you expect in this product.It looks good out fo the box on day 1, though."
,on,2,positive,"Not as powerful as I’d hoped, but convenient for travel."
,on,7,positive,"feels like the body of the brush vibrates more than the head which is odd, and the bristles are extremely soft. but the color is so fun! and the size is great."
,on,11,positive,Bought this as a cheap option when my other electric tooth brush crapped out. Overall it’s ok. Good for travel but the head of the brush doesn’t vibrate that much.
,April,2023,negative,"This one is the worst electric brush, entire brush vibrates except the bristles which ideally should have vibrations. Too noisy as well.Better to use a normal brush instead !"
,on,14,neutral,The battery cover would not stay on so it was returned.
,on,13,positive,If the bristles weren’t so soft it would be perfect. I don’t feel like my teeth are getting properly cleaned.
,on,31,positive,"Loved the looks and the sleek design of this brush. Love the fact that it comes with a cover so it stays clean in your toilet kit. That said the head only vibrates and I found that its not that effective at really cleaning your teeth, olus the shape of the head makes it hard to clean behind the teeth.. at least it is for me. A round head with a spinning mechanism would have worked much much better. and been more effective at cleaning the back of your teeth.. but it still makes a good travel solution."
,on,9,positive,"If you own the original sonicare brush you know to just hold it and let the brush do the cleaning. This brush is easy to hold and Is beautifully designed, but it lacks the power and ends up being used like a regular mechanical brush."
,on,10,negative,Stopped working less than a month
,on,3,negative,"Feels much more powerful than my Quip, maybe twice as much. My teeth are definitely cleaner.In less than a year i’m on my second brush and it’s broken again."
,on,5,negative,I should have bought the more expensive one. The power in this is useless!
,on,20,negative,Didn’t last long till battery went out. So didn’t get to use it for very long.
,November,2022,neutral,I cannot tell the difference between this $40 brush and a cheap $10 electric brush. quality is very cheap and brush head doesn't even have a tongue scraper
