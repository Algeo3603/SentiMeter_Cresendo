3.0,December,2023,negative,"The nostle  push in /out button is stuck after 4 months of  usage. I bought  with one year  extended warranty. Please  suggest how to return  , get repaired or  get replacement."
3.0,November,2023,negative,"Hi team,My oracura water floss, which was working so good, But now it's water pressure has reduced. Can you please help what s wrong? Is there any warranty ? Is there any battery i can replace it with?Please help"
3.0,October,2023,positive,This smart flosser helps me to keep a good dental health and remove debris as i have braces on.
3.0,August,2023,negative,"The device helps clean teeth but the water flow even in soft mode is a bit harsh. This causes senstive gums to bleed. Even in non-pulsating mode, it comes in pulses. Perhaps a finer nozzle may help."
3.0,August,2023,positive,
3.0,October,2022,negative,"The ORACURA OC001 model comes with a case, which is probably only useful for travel as the tip needs to dismantled the tip to fit.It works well, not sure if it can replace manual flossing. The water jet power may take some practice to get used to.The USB  cable comes with a nonstandard connector ( not the usual micro USB/C found in phones), so make sure you don’t lose the cable!A few issues to note:1) Has a non-removable battery2) Only a press button ON-OFF, easily turns on by accidental touch. I don't know how to pack this for travel without it turning on by itself (unless enclosed in the case)3) As mentioned, a non-standard USB charging cable, if lost would make the product uselessThe product is decent, but it looks like it was designed by some one who has no product design experience (or practical/common-sense). Hope they fix these issues in future (a long shot as they are unlikely to read this review!)."
1.0,January,2024,negative,This was the worst product i bought on amazon  The pressure is so high. My gums started to bleed.  I tried all the heads. No use. It does nothing. There is no return policy after shelling out so much money.  Provably this can be used for holi. For spraying colored water.Bad experince
3.0,February,2024,positive,good product recommend it to everyone. good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good and good.
3.0,February,2024,positive,The implant tip needs better designing for greater access. Please kindly look into it so that other customers are not inconvenienced
3.0,June,2016,positive,"This is my second oral irrigations system. Oral irrigators are best cleaning procedure for interdental cleaning and it not only cleans up the mouth but also removes problems like bad bredth, tooth decay etc which arise out of decomposition of lodged food particles which normally remain even after a thorough brushing. They also help in reducing tooth enamel loss which is normally caused by tooth brushes leading to teeth sensitivity. Hence I use tooth brush only for few seconds lightly followed by a oral irrigator such as water pic.My first system was a water pic which was purchased from the authorized dealer from Mumbai via post (it was not available online). The water pic lasted for about 3 years and ultimately its pump broke and hence as an urgent replacement I bought the smart flosser.Oral Care smart flosser reviewPROS:Handy, battery operated which can be recharged and lasts for about 10+ days during initial days. Do not know how it will perform after 3-6 monthsIt can be carried around during travel, compact and handy.Does reasonably good cleaningCONS:Water reservoir is smaller compared to water pic which has a separate 500 ml tankDifficult to reach the underside of the teeth specially the lower jaw since it needs to be kept upright in order for it to receive water which is picked by a tube reaching to the bottom of its tiny reservoir. For reaching lower jaw underside you have to tilt it which makes the job tough.It is made in china but finish is very good so the quality can be trusted but not aware what to do when battery runs out.VERDICTIf you wish to go for a good oral irrigator then go for Water Pic which is more sturdy, has a flexible nozzle with a tube connecting to pump and reservoir. However if you have a water pic already and are always on the move you can go for oral care which is compact and useful with its limitations as mentioned above"
3.0,May,2023,positive,"It was repackaged but I tried it was working fine, so kept it.There are 3 modes normal soft and pulse, even soft mode is too strong, should have been more soft range in this one."
3.0,July,2023,positive,Useful for best floss result.Needs practice to get best result
2.0,September,2023,negative,I dis not get any relief ( from gum pain) for which it was prescribed by the dentist. One has to fill water everything you want to use. Ease of Assembly was OK and storage too. The main concern is of its oral benefits are doubtful.
3.0,April,2023,positive,Product is good but between high intensity and low they should be a middle one as well. Becuase high intesity is too high and low is to low
1.0,February,2024,negative,"The most useless product. Neither it will remove food particles, nor anything. Forget about tartar."
2.0,November,2023,positive,
1.0,February,2024,negative,worst product
3.0,November,2021,positive,"You need to hold the tip of the nossle close to your teeth and close your mouth while using it, else water will splash on your dress, bathroom/washbasin tiles, mirror and even spectacles. If you spray on your lips by mistake it will hurt, even in soft mode.Would have been good if the nossle length was more at the 90 degree bend so that water does not fall on the equipment. Good thing the equipment is water resistant. But have to wash it after use, else will stink of saliva.The on off button to control equipment should have been on one side and the other mode buttons at the bottom, so that we do not press it by mistake while cleaning.Would have been good if the product could fit in travel box with the power port gaurd on it. Very hard to remove and close it when needed.Good product otherwise, great idea"
2.0,October,2023,negative,The water leaks out from several points rendering the gadget useless. Not worth wasting money on.
3.0,November,2022,negative,"As it claims deep cleansing, I am using it every week but still I can see durt accumated at inner side of my teeth. Also this is little difficult to use as you need to hold mirror at one hand and use it.I would rather go to clinic once in a six month."
2.0,August,2023,negative,Purchased in August 2022 less than 1 year ago and started giving problems since a weekTried to charge several times but it seems to stop charging within 2 minutes or so after which it runs for barely 1 minute againWarranty is supposed to be for 18 months !!
1.0,January,2024,neutral,"I have bought in sep now its not charging, don't know how to cover warranty"
3.0,March,2023,positive,Force is good but not constant. There is a nominal interval in between. The lower body has a scratch sign suggestive of that piece is used before.
3.0,January,2024,negative,"No doubt the flosser is very handy,But the water pressure is too low and doesn’t provide good clean and the water tank is too small.Due to slow cleaning have to fill the water repeatedly.Might be good for kids, but not at all for adults"
3.0,January,2023,negative,I am unable to charge the equipment. It worked very well with initial charge with whatever charge it had at the time of purchase. Please do the needful.
1.0,November,2023,negative,"There are three modes like Normal, soft etc. and all function the same. In fact I showed it to a dentist today and found that the product I received has a defect because all the modes are giving the same pressure. It is hurting my teeth and gums"
3.0,October,2022,positive,Got this as a gift. Took a while to use it but have been using it for the last few days. A bit too early to post a full on review but it's been ok so far. Will update this review in a few weeks post usage.
2.0,May,2023,negative,"The slowest mode is the Soft mode. The speed of the water of that mode itself is way too high.Just switch on the flosser and see, you can spray in a straight line for almost 8-10 feet. There is no way, i will keep that high-speed water in my mouth. i have stopped using the flosser."
1.0,December,2023,positive,
3.0,September,2022,negative,"Everything went well until the first recharge. Charging is not staying after the first recharge. The device motor is working by itself when it is off and idle, which drains the battery. Not sure how to fix it now."
2.0,July,2023,negative,I find it hard to use this as the flow of water is so fast that it hurts the gums each time.
3.0,November,2022,negative,"Product stopped working after a few days and wouldn't charge. Since there is no return policy, it was a waste of money."
3.0,January,2023,positive,
1.0,December,2023,negative,Unable to charge it after 3-4 months
3.0,July,2022,positive,"Easy to use, handy, portable, well designed, 3 modes for your teeth type. Tank capacity is also good. Overall good product.. Battery life may he a problem after a few months of use"
1.0,November,2023,negative,Stopped working shortly after buying. So expensive and it didn't even last over a month. Not worth it
2.0,May,2023,negative,"The water jet is so powerful despite the many modes to use it on, that the whole experience ends up being quite u comfortable. And the water finishes up so quickly that you need to fill, each time after a single use. Also, you get quite drenched after all the squirts of water, so wearing clothing while doing this is not an option. Wish someone had told me all this prior to purchase…"
1.0,December,2023,negative,"Horrible battery, doesn't work properly even after charging for a day."
3.0,October,2022,negative,Bought it in October 2022 and stopped working early in May 2023...I see other reviews of the same kind.
3.0,December,2021,negative,"thr are only 3 speeds.. high speed can damage gums nd create small wounds..so switched to waterpik has 10 speeds. This Can use for emergency purpose, when u can't take waterpik that has cord nd need power supply."
2.0,March,2023,positive,The Battery ran out .not available any where .how it went out so early .help me to get a new battery
2.0,May,2023,negative,Product not charging after 8 months and it's difficult to figure out how will I avail warranty.
3.0,September,2021,positive,Might take some time to get used to how to use it correctly and at what pressure. However it’s a very useful product. Please be careful when using it at first… start with lower pressure and figure out which direction you want to use it and how far from the teeth.
3.0,October,2017,negative,"i bought it at the end of july 2017, used it couple of times in first 2 months. then on the 3rd month (19th october) was using it, and within a minute battery died, which is ok so I put in charge then after 15 minutes i saw it got started automatically while in the charge. so I pressed the button to stop it, and found out that button is too hot, so i unplugged it from charging and left it to cool down.then its no longer working. i tried to charge again, but i found out the buttons goes very hot after some time and the charging light no longer blinks, it stays on all the time, even after i disconnect it from charging. and its not starting anymore.Now i dont know what to do with it. its pretty costly to just throw it away after a month.Update: I called their customer care, and they sent me a replacement part. Good service"
1.0,December,2023,negative,Charger not working
1.0,October,2023,negative,It’s difficult for a first timer. Your guns will bleed if they are not 100% healthy with the force it’s get applies. Be careful.
1.0,October,2022,negative,Using thread flossing was very cumbersome and time taking hence i had gone with Oracura flosser.Since last 3 weeks I'm using and for me it don't work.During first day of its use in soft mode my gums started bleeding heavily which leads me to visit dentist. Doctor explained that due to existence of plaque the gums area weak hence water flossing will definitely cause bleeding for a week or so. And i got my teeth de stained with all removed plaque. But now i got new issue with sensitivity which also got worst after using Oracura water flossing. I was advised to use water flossing everyday once before going bed.Practically it doesn't work for my teeth structure as they are compact and no lose pockets are present which traps the food particles. For me water rinsing is enough.But may be it's useful to those who are having braces or dental implants or aged people having gaps or pockets between tooth.
3.0,December,2020,negative,"I did not use it after 4-5 usage. The product is working good. But there are some problems that discouraged me from using it again.1. First thing is that the water storage is very less. It's a hassle to fill it again and again.2. Secondly I felt that the force of water is very strong. Not only it  hurts the gums, in case you have got a cap inside it can throw it off after 2-3 usage. So you need to be very careful.3. It's costly."
1.0,September,2023,negative,All that the manufacturer shows in the video is far from reality. It hardly removes or facilitates cleaning from the molars etc. It is nothing else but gargling. So I am disappointed. Will never recommend this for flossing.
1.0,October,2023,neutral,"Bought it for 2 times, but stop working, after 3months. Will not buy again."
1.0,October,2023,negative,In last 2 months 2 times stopped working. Waste of money.
1.0,October,2023,negative,It Got defective twice. I was being approached on watsapp by company people to write positive review and get extra warranty
2.0,May,2023,negative,The flosser led to bleeding gums. I asked for demo and no one contacted.
2.0,November,2021,negative,"My dentist recommended that I buy a water pik and after checking reviews I bought this item. Since this is the first time I am using such a product, I find the spray even at soft setting too much for my teeth or gum cleaning . I feel I have wasted so much money since it is not returnable so I recommend purchase with caution . I also did not find any place where the product manufacturer location/country is listed . This is surprising as I thought listing country of manufacturing is mandatory on all products especially such an expensive and delicate equipment"
1.0,August,2023,positive,
3.0,October,2022,negative,Not useful for cleaning teeth
3.0,August,2022,negative,Water pressure too hard and working only in pulse mode and not on normal mode
1.0,July,2023,negative,"The speed at which the water comes out of the flosser is very high even on soft mode, making it very difficult to use. The water splashes all around your body and the mirror and wash basin making it ugly. ALso, the intensity and strength felt on the gums and mouth is too high causing injuries."
1.0,February,2022,negative,"I just had my braces and wanted to ensure keep the tooth clean after every meal. Was going through the websites and found this one to be the apt one based on all their marketing pics and write up. I did went through reviews which had high number of good reviews however I did went one customer claiming that the pressure was high and the user had bleeding 😳 which I casually ignored it. For the first time when I used this I started to have bleeding too because of the high pressure even in the soft mode 🤦. When I wanted refund this product that's were I understood that this not refundable product and my 2K gone for waste . So please don't get carried away with the high number of good reviews , my simple logic is why is this not a refundable product , any product you would like to test and then buy in this situation I have to blame Amazon if we need to buy online shopping it has to be tested before we could buy to give us comfort and experience similar to shop purchase ."
3.0,August,2021,positive,"Force is remarkable. and the box given for the travelling is very good for organizing.But problem is with the tank, water completes so fast you are suppose to be ready with 3 glasses and refill every time."
3.0,January,2021,negative,Not too happy .. it came without a charging base cover which makes it quite risky while filling up the tank.. increases the chances of water dripping in to the charging base. The manual book mentions a charging base cover but I did not receive it. And this product is non-returnable. kindly check with the seller before buying
3.0,November,2021,neutral,If you don't know how to use it don't buy it or buy it but use very carefully. Low pressure mode is not slow enough for biggeners. This is biggest draw back
1.0,September,2023,positive,"It cleaned only 1-2% of tartar for me in 20-30 attempts.With 150ml capacity, it only works for 30 seconds"
3.0,August,2020,negative,"I bought this product based on my doctor's recommendation to buy a water flosser. The product is handy and after couple of days of use, one learn how to handle the movement inside mouth. I found the product vibrates and water comes on normal mode also as pulses. The flow of water is not like without vibration and a uniform jet. I'm not sure if the product is designed like that or this is my product specific issue."
2.0,July,2022,negative,"It takes time to master to use it, i find it really frustrating. When I tried to use it for first time, water splashed everywhere. For elderly people this is not at all useful. If the water splashes on your gum, it hurts. There is no option to return unless it is defective. Think twice before you order it"
2.0,April,2023,negative,Only worked for eleven months then conked out
1.0,October,2023,neutral,Product is not working after 2 weeks.
1.0,November,2022,positive,"The product is good. Does a pretty good job of interdental cleaning.BUT! BIGGEST DRAWBACK is that the dentist recommends replacing the tip every 3-4 months. The device comes with ONE spare tip. So 6 - 8 months down the line you will have to buy a new tip. THERE IS NO STANDARD TIP AVAILABLE TO PURCHASE SEPARATELY! There are specialized tip available: orthodontic, pocket cleaner and tongue scraped. BUT NO STANDARD TIP. Which means that 6 - 8 months down the line you will have to purchase a new device altogether. That MAKES IT TOO EXPENSIVE.They can easily offer a standard tip for purchasing separately but for some unknown reason they dont sell it. Search on Amazon and Search on the oracura store on Amazon: it ISNT EVEN LISTED AS A PRODUCT!"
2.0,August,2021,positive,I was very much confident at the time of purchase and initial use because of the good star rating and reviews. After one year I am fed-up with the poor battery backup. I am getting backup for only two days. In all other respect it is good. I am not recommending this as best buy. Strictly after one year and one month from the date of purchase 08-08-2021 it is stopped. I am very much disappointed for the large amount of Rs 2070 that I had given at the time of purchase.
1.0,September,2023,negative,Not worth buying.  Very bad experience.  Not value for money.
3.0,April,2022,negative,Water flosser is good but the toothbrush is not so good
1.0,August,2023,positive,"It's like water canon. Gums bleeding due to high water pressure. Spills water all over face,clothes,mirror & surroundings. Cannot use. Want to return.  Let me know procedure."
2.0,April,2023,positive,Water leakage issue with the tank
3.0,October,2023,positive,It’s value for money as long as it works…This is the 2nd one I boughtThe 1st one I used over a year and it got spoilt since no one can repair it I bought againI hope this one lasts longer
1.0,August,2023,negative,Gums bleed in seconds. Super painful product to use. Perhaps if u wish to save your gums and teeth for longer - discard and pick something more sensible. Money drain !!
3.0,February,2022,negative,Liked the product for deep clearing but not suitable for sensitive gums.
3.0,March,2016,positive,"The item is useful for oral cleaning. The force is quite good and cleans interdental spaces quite well. The mouth feels very clean after a session. The water gets over quickly. In one session I fill the unit 3 or 4 times. This is not a major problem as it can be easily refilled in a few seconds. It is compact so it is easy to store and take on journeys. There are no leakages. There is only one type of nozzle so in some cases it may be a handicap. Some more nozzle types would help to reach difficult areas.Advantages: (1) Compact unit, (2) forceful jet (3) No leakages.Disadvantages: (1) Only one nozzle type."
3.0,June,2022,negative,On/ off button stopped working after 6 months use
1.0,September,2023,positive,
3.0,February,2022,positive,Good only for hard cleaning. Regular cleaning it is painful on gums even in soft mode
3.0,May,2021,positive,Product is excellent. But I didn't get the charging base cover in package. I will change the rating to 5 stars if I get the charging base cover. Thanks ORACURA!!
1.0,September,2023,positive,Worked only for 10 days
3.0,October,2023,neutral,"My water flosser is not charging properly, even after charging it works only for 2 minutes,I think it has some battery issues."
1.0,September,2022,positive,
3.0,November,2017,positive,The Flosser is really useful for a quick clean. Feels fresh especially when u don ve time during late night flossing!!. Two major drawbacks that i found.1.The water container leaks a bit when it is over filled and spills water all over while flossing! .2. The control option is a bit too heavy though we keep it on soft mode it is really hard on the gums! makes u bleed not handled carefully!Hoping for an improvement in the product. Thanks!
1.0,August,2023,negative,The product caused bleeding of gums with force of water
1.0,March,2023,negative,"Too much water pressure. My injure your gums and prosthesis. Children don't use. Recommended by my dentist . I don't think she has seen it working so took it with me next time to show her. It is not easy to use as shown in official video. Splashes all over, your clothes and bathroom. But at your own risk.PLEASE NOTE THIS IS NON RETURNABLE IN AMAZON"
2.0,November,2021,negative,"The Flosser has three modes : Normal (high water pressure) , Soft (Low water pressure) , Pulse (gum massage with water) . The soft mode itself has a high water pressure that gums can be harmed . Device should be only used by a professional doctor because of its High speed jet . It is not returnable product , so be awre before you purchase ."
1.0,August,2023,negative,It starts bleeding the gums even while using soft mode. Complete waste of money. I can't return since it's non returnable.
3.0,June,2021,positive,Working well when I have received it! Easy to use ! The protective box doesn't have place for the charging wire
3.0,April,2022,positive,
3.0,March,2022,positive,Seems Good
2.0,May,2021,negative,"I have a problem.The device has no external damage.But the water pressure at the outlet of the device is too high (in all modes). When using the device, the gums and tongue are injured, and then small bleeding begins.It dangerous!Previously, I already twice bought similar devices from the same manufacturer through Amazon, but then I had no complaints about the devices. They still work fine and I have something to compare with."
2.0,July,2022,positive,"Expensive, thanks to Amazon with few offer product is made affordablePressure is very high which at times is difficult to controlWater tankstorage is low you to to refill it"
1.0,July,2023,negative,"It starts working by it's on , without pressing the button and stopped working .. very bad experience"
1.0,March,2021,negative,"ORACURA Smart Water Flosser OC001 was bought for dental flossing for my wife.  But the pressure produced by this device (even in soft mode) is very high. She got her tongue injured with this pressure.  I did not agree with her.  Tried my self.  Watched several videos they have on Youtube.  but nothing helps.  This equipment's pressure, even in its lowest pressure mode, is very high.  It injured the gums and gums started bleeding.  We even tried not looking at Mirror while flossing (as recommended by few videos).  But it did not help.  within seconds the injury happened.  This is my experience.  May be I am wrong.  But this is the truth I experienced.  Someone from Oracura want talk to me, they can do so."
1.0,July,2023,positive,"Worst product used by Police not for dental problems, dont buy"
1.0,January,2023,negative,"Speed of the jet is so fast that i started bleeding from my gum. water tank is also small, water finishes very fast. Speed at the both the modes are same.  Pls purchase the flosser with water tank , has various speed levels and is refundable. please don't buy this one. I wish to return and it says that it is not refundable."
3.0,September,2016,positive,"Functionally it is fine and effective. But it has one major drawback that it's water capacity is very less. So it runs out of water just after 1 minute of usage. We need to frequently refill water to use it for 5-10 minutes. The water tank should have be little larger.  I give three stars for its quality, performance and efficacy,but cut two stars for its inqdequate water capacity. I neither recommend nor advice people to reject this product. Make your decision considering all the aspects."
