1.0,October,2023,positive,"This is a total Gimmicky product with not so useful features. It does give you a feel good factor of vibration but apart from that it is a total waste. I have used better products like Oral-B, Braun, etc and they are pretty good because they help you clean between teeths and help remove plaque/food debris. I can understand the cost difference but if I am paying 1000 bucks I atleast expect some functionality than a bloody vibrator for mouth. They are just redeeming their Shark Tank experience to trick people with their money."
3.0,May,2023,negative,"The vibrations are lower than that from agaro. I switched from agaro to this mainly because of its sleek look but the cleanliness after brushing is lesser as compared to the agaro one. But this one is hassle free as I do not have to charge it because it is battery operated. So I guess it's up to your preference what you want. If this is your first switch from normal brush to electric one, you will not be disappointed."
1.0,February,2024,neutral,The functioning of the tooth brush is similar to a normal toothbrush. The bristels are vey small and the seller does not accept the return eventhough we do not use. And on their website they easy returns without any restrictions.
3.0,May,2023,positive,
3.0,May,2023,positive,The toothbrush is good for the price point however I found it a bit gimmicky
1.0,December,2023,neutral,"This is an absolute useless product with literally no functionality at all. All it does is vibrates, that's about it. The bristles don't rotate, niether do anything. Literally a 20 rupee toothbrush is far better than this.Don't call this an electric toothbrush. It's just a vibrator for your mouth."
1.0,February,2024,positive,NOT WORKING ONLY VIBRATING
3.0,February,2022,negative,"I was not happy wit the piece I received. The toothhead cap does nt cover well. .also it doesnt do the job well. But it looks really nice.. and the timer function is good. .i used oral b crossaction for about 10 years and now aftr using perfora, i feel that oral b's cleaning was much superior. My mouth always felt fresh after using oral b, but nothng hapng aftr using this.I was really excited when i orderd ths but i am not satisfied wit the product."
3.0,December,2021,neutral,I have been using this brush for 20 days and I can say that there is no remarkable difference between an electric toothbrush and the traditional brush.There is no enhanced cleanliness or lasting clean feel. The plaque build begins as usual and no later.As a feedback I'd like the bristle head to be a lil bigger.
2.0,January,2022,negative,"Disclaimer - My wife is a dentist and we bought this product to see how beneficial it is.The product has more cons than pros.a. The sonic motor provides mild vibration. You still have to do your regular brushing action (rotary or modified bass technique).b. Properly Brushing the inside portion of your teeth is difficult when compared to your regular toothbrush.c. If you have slightly crowded teeth, then it is difficult to maneuver the brush into the crannies to remove any plaque or stuck food particles."
1.0,October,2023,negative,"Ultrasonic vibration is just marketing gimmick, it doesn‚Äôt do any good. Waste of money. Have been using Oral p600 from past 4 years, every penny spent on it is worth it!"
3.0,July,2022,neutral,No AAA battery as per the pack. It wasn‚Äôt there on the inside pack! But it was mentioned on the package!
3.0,November,2021,positive,"The brush has a sleek design which gives a good hold. Although, the brush is not very effective in terms of the power and the vibration fluctuates every time  the brush is turned around."
3.0,April,2022,positive,"The battery is very good. I was using oral B and that is a very problematic product, had to charge every 3 days."
2.0,February,2023,positive,"Its just simple brush with vibrator, better go with Philips or Oralb as you will get rotary and vibrator both."
2.0,August,2022,positive,It looks great. Not sure what the point of the mild vibrations is. The bristles don‚Äôt move like in most electric toothbrushes so you just have a normal brush which kind of goes buzz in your mouth.
3.0,July,2022,positive,Cool stuff.Worth it!
1.0,October,2023,negative,The bristles of the brush were damanged
1.0,September,2023,negative,Its starting automatically and consuming battery. Not good
1.0,September,2023,negative,It‚Äôs just a toothbrush with a vibrator. Not at all worthed.0 stars.
2.0,October,2022,negative,After using for 10 months the battery life has reduced to around 10 days.. I am going to change my brush to the rechargeable ones now
1.0,January,2022,positive,"The bristles barely vibrates.sorry, but don't serves the purposeno wonder the battery lasts 3 monthsThe look is excellent.Amazon kindly refunded after explaining the situation, since item non returnableFirst time electric toothbrush uses don't know what they are missing.I have been using caresmith electric toothbrust for the last 2 years, it is white in colour, so there were lot of colour changes. But the performance is 10 times better than this one.Even the oral b tooth brush is better, but lasts only 2-3 months."
1.0,March,2022,positive,"I was in the market for a good electric toothbrush and everything on the market was very bulky or expensive. After an extensive search found this and thought it looks amazing and sleek. Initial days I was impressed but slowly the faults surfaced,1) The brush head doesn't vibrate as much as it should.2) There is a contact thing with the battery I guess, it only works at a particular point. So you need to keep rotating the brush until it starts to vibrate.If the company can come up with a redesign or improved version maybe I will buy one until then sayonora!"
1.0,June,2023,negative,How is this a toothbrush when it doesn't work. It just vibrates. I switched to oral b cross action for a fraction of this products price and felt stupid for buying this.
2.0,November,2022,negative,Not worth it. Does not feel good. Just a high vibration stick which i fail to see any advantage of
1.0,December,2022,negative,Was excited to pick up this toothbrush because of their marketing but I was left feeling confused after using it - the brush portion doesn‚Äôt vibrate but the rest of the toothbrush does. Gave me a hand ache & a headache. I had an Oral B before this and just the bristles moved. I‚Äôm still confused.
1.0,June,2023,negative,Stupid product where bristles don‚Äôt even move. Whole toothbrush vibrates instead. All the vibration is subsided by the hand itself. Zero value for money.Stop selling it under the name of ‚ÄúElectric toothbrush‚Äù
2.0,January,2022,positive,"Good looking thing, but the brush heads last for a week before they get completely mangled. At 399 a fortnight, there are much better products with a higher initial cost but lower running cost that are worth a look."
1.0,August,2022,neutral,"I thought an electric toothbrush would  really halp me clean my teeth better and minimise my efforts but TBH it didn't change anything. It just vibrates, rest is all the same as a manual toothbrush. Trust me when I say this, ""Stick to the normal brush."" The product is of nice quality and everything but doesn't change the experience of brushing at all."
1.0,April,2023,negative,Ordered brush for parents. Found item or part missing. Since we found it post returning period so even can't return on Amazon.Bought 2 packs. I was fine but 2nd one like pic attached
1.0,May,2023,negative,Packaging is bad and brush is not soft at all. I won't recommend this overprized item. Many other in market are softer than this.
1.0,March,2023,negative,Compared to other electric toothbrushes this is more like a just a vibrating toothbrush without any actual movement in the bristles. You need to still manually brush. Waste of money!
2.0,November,2021,negative,"Prolong use will impact teeth, not fit for diabetics or people older than 50.Poor product."
1.0,September,2022,negative,"A completely useless product as it prevents your pencil from charging ,since it is very thick. Decided to give it to my Dog üê∂ to chew it and play around ..."
1.0,May,2022,negative,Doesn't provide any benefit over a normal toothbrush.Brush body vibrates instead of the brush head.
1.0,November,2021,positive,It was working perfectly for like 30 days and on the 31st day it kind of stopped working by itself all of a sudden.
1.0,August,2022,negative,"toothbrush doesn't work like it should be, compering to amount it cost."
1.0,March,2023,neutral,nonsense
1.0,March,2022,neutral,brush only vibrates but bristles dont move...there is no logic of it being electric when it has to be used manually.
1.0,January,2022,negative,Bought it over a month ago and it doesn‚Äôt work anymore. Tried changing batteries to no avail.
1.0,January,2023,positive,üë∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1.0,September,2021,neutral,The handle where the battery is vabrates. The brush doesn‚Äôt rotate. Useless.
1.0,December,2021,negative,"Very week motor, literally useless."
1.0,December,2021,positive,
1.0,January,2022,neutral,No difference between this and manual toothbrush
1.0,December,2021,neutral,The product doesn't match the picture and functionality.
1.0,December,2021,neutral,This Brush does not have movement rotation etc
3.0,December,2021,positive,"First con which i noticed in the brush is Vibrations are mild and there is no moment of bristles due to the vibrations which is not the case with other electric brushes from oral B, MI etc. This is mainly due to the brush's mechanism where the machine just produces vibrations but not mechanical moments. Therefore there is no value addition of buying an electric brush since it is like a regular brush with just mild vibration. Other than this others features are good."
1.0,October,2023,negative,"Got the toothbrush , mouthwash and tongue cleaner. Sad to say after a week of use I‚Äôm really disappointed with the toothbrush and mouthwash .Specially the toothbrush in my opinion has lots of flaws .1. The button placement is really awkward. As it‚Äôs a press button it turns off on me accidentally while brushing .2. The brush just barely vibrates which in my opinion didn‚Äôt do anything better or helped me do any cleaning which I couldn‚Äôt do without a normal brush .3. The complete build is made of plastic which is first very bad for the environment and second is very weak and it kept of opening apart with little pressure on it.Investing 1200rs in it isint worth the investment. I‚Äôd rather stick with my existing Bamboo brush as it‚Äôs good for nature, and easy to use.Only good is it‚Äôs easy to assemble it all back together."
3.0,February,2022,neutral,"The toothbrush is not as what I expected, it is that simple and feature less, body design is slim and attractive."
3.0,January,2022,positive,Over priced tooth brush. This tooth brush price should have not more than 800 INR. Better go to another brand.
2.0,August,2022,negative,Not up to the mark. There are better electric toothbrush for a much lesser price. Not a happy customer. Bad Purchase
3.0,January,2022,positive,"UPDATE: I take good care of my things and the toothbrush failed after six months of use. The Perfora customer service team is also not the best. It took a great deal of effort to get a replacement brush. I know they're a young company going through growing pains and I'm hopeful they make more humane adjustments to their policies and protocols.ORIGINAL REVIEWI've had a few electric toothbrushes in the past including sonicare and quip. This is closer to quip in build but I think perfora is better made. Quip was difficult to swap brush heads and batteries, with perfora it's really easy and doesn't seem like it'll break. The packaging is also minimal which is a plus.The toothbrush head size is slightly smaller than I'm used to but I'm okay with it - a little larger with more bristles would be nicer. I like how the back of the brush head is flat, feels good while brushing."
2.0,April,2022,negative,The vibration is very mild. I had to brush like how i would normally. The bristles also got spoilt easily.
1.0,August,2023,neutral,Go for Oral-B or some other rotating brush. This is useless. I used Oral-B before and it was much better
1.0,August,2023,positive,
1.0,February,2023,neutral,"Its not an electric brush ,just normal with a vibrator doesnt have any rotary function they should clearly mention the same ,you will feel confused what to do with this if you had already used any rotary brush"
1.0,July,2023,positive,Honest review - it does nothing other than vibration better use non electric or use oral B which rotates atleast
1.0,March,2023,negative,"It does nothing except for making vibration NOISE. DOESNT EVEN VIBRATE, JUST MAKES A SOUND. NO difference between this and a manual toothbrush apart from the noise it creates... No ease of nursing or superior brushing..this is not what am electric toothbrush is. This is such a scam and overpriced daily toothbrush. I want my money back."
1.0,May,2023,negative,"Please do not waste your money on this , the worst brush ever . Have wasted my money here.It is very awful and is of no use the bristles do not move it just vibrates , and your head will start aching."
1.0,April,2022,negative,Do you like a lot of foam in your mouth? If so then this is your toothbrush. They just added a vibrator to a normal tooth brush and made it an electric toothbrush. It doesn‚Äôt perform like any other toothbrushes in the market as it can only get foam and doesn‚Äôt perform any cross action.It reminded of that vibration machine that a barber wears on his hand while giving an head massage.
1.0,February,2022,negative,Cheap plasticNo bristle movementCan't charge the brushBristles are very hardInserting and taking out AAA cell is very inconvenient
