3.0,July,2023,negative,"I have been using the perfora toothbrush for 1-2 months now, and it's a very good experience overall... The product is good only, not very good, but okayish in this price range... But the customer care is worst. They will just reply you 'we will soon connect you to an agent' and that's a never ending story.. Perhaps one of the worst customer care I ever saw... You can buy the product, but at your own risk, if you need customer service help, then you're gone."
3.0,February,2024,negative,Go for it if you are a new to electric toothbrush. I downgraded from a Philips Sonicare and found the 24k vibrations too subtle. It hardly feels like the bristles is doing anything
3.0,December,2023,positive,
3.0,November,2023,positive,Nice
2.0,December,2023,negative,"Just 1 year into using this product, the single button started malfunctioning. It gets on automatically and eventually the entire battery is consumed. Have been partially satisfied with the product itself till the time I could use it, however INR 1K for an electric toothbrush to last an year is not a sign of a good build quality or overall product. Next purchase will not be from this brand."
2.0,January,2024,neutral,This is my first electric toothbrush and after using this I honestly don’t understand the hype around going electric. The vibration is just too subtle and I don’t see any difference in cleaning either.Friends have suggested to go for round brushes so Il try that next time but with this perfora brush I’m pretty disappointed. It hasn’t made any difference in my brushing experience.
2.0,December,2023,negative,Its a Cheap product compared to its price with poor bristle quality and overall shape n size compared to regular tooth brushes. I have opened n used it to test it so couldn’t return it.
3.0,September,2023,positive,Average performance of products
3.0,November,2022,positive,"It's a quite simplistic brush, bristle are very soft  compared to any. Cleaning is also OK. I was doubting before buying that if the brush would have good water resistance or not but it has cleared on that and surely its a long lasting product. Since i used other brand like Hammer and those products are poor quality. Perfora is good in that. However I have used realme sonic n1 and m1 so perfora brushing quality didn't appealed me like the realme as realme brush makes me feel that it is cleaning deeply.Perfora brush is good for travelling purpose as it have normal dry cell and no Li-ion cell so no problem of any kind of issues one faces with Li-ion cells.I would say if one like to have two brushes then keep one as perfora and one any other like philips or realme."
3.0,September,2023,positive,"Good buy. The only downside is lesser vibrations. There are brushes with upto 40,000 vibrations."
2.0,December,2023,negative,"Not as effective as i thought, i think i need more hard brush, or more rigorous vibrations"
3.0,July,2023,neutral,If you are fascinated with these new age electric brushes this isn’t the one as this the brush where the wand vibrates not the bristles.
2.0,December,2023,negative,Replacement heads are too costly almost close to the price of the product.
1.0,February,2024,negative,Just feels and work like a normal ordinary toothbrush only. With this price range other brushes such as OralB and Colgate are better options. Such a waste of money! Please don't buy.
2.0,November,2023,neutral,It did not meet the expectation as promoted in the description. I have used agaro electric brush in the past but agaro is far better than this brush.
3.0,April,2023,positive,"I loved this electric toothbrush it's my first experience with electric toothbrush and perfora performed very well it's battery operated so easy to use 90 days , can wash it it's waterproof I used it once a day it makes teeth clear in more better way ..at this price range it's come with a great quality go for it"
3.0,January,2023,positive,"Pros : The brush has a pretty sleek design. Looks good. And comfortable to clean internal teeth. The bristles area is also small, so vertical and circular motion is easily done comparted to wide and long bristle-area toothbrush. The battery also went for more than 9 months with one time in one day use.Cons: I don't feel any substantial difference, in terms of cleaning due to its vibration. After 9 months of use, I would either go for a circular movement for a try. Or just a sleek designed toothbrush for good reach."
3.0,June,2023,positive,"Firstly, they delivered lavendar instead of yellow. This brush is too narrow from top, and head size is too small too. The strokes per min don't seem right. It's an ok purchase but I prefer the other model by this brand."
3.0,June,2023,positive,I like the design of the toothbrush and the modes are fine but if there would have been more then it would have been nice but certainly works at this price point.
3.0,July,2023,positive,The strokes that the brush offers are good. Used it just 4 times so far. Will update in the future
1.0,January,2024,negative,"They have gave me a faulty piece it stops for few seconds every half minute, then will stop working completely after 2 minutes, you again start it by pressing the button and this continues till you finish brushing"
2.0,September,2023,negative,"I ordered 2 brushes, One of them is good but the other brush which I got is defeated. I have to change the battery in every 2 days. It stops working the very next day. I don't know what's wrong with it."
3.0,June,2023,negative,Sonic vibrations are very low.Clean tooth is not good
1.0,January,2024,negative,"It is just vibrating brush, does not clean,not useful at all. Not good for sensitive teeth as well"
1.0,January,2024,negative,Not as gud as expected its only for handicapped people who cant move brush
3.0,May,2023,negative,Bristle too soft. Vibration too weak. Not worth the money.
2.0,July,2023,negative,"not very useful in electric tooth brush segment , as the micro vibration of bristles is never felt in mouth, but over all quality , design , steadyness, waterproofing etc are very well done on this product..."
2.0,September,2023,negative,It will be better to buy from a renowned brand than falling prey to this 'Shark Tank' entrant .. It's just a cheap vibrator !
1.0,October,2023,negative,"I would seriously recommend buying any electric brush of oral b rather than this. It doesn’t work like an electric brush; it just vibrates a little and that’s about it. Doesn’t really help cleaning the plaque from teeth. Also, one of the bristles in my packet doesnt even fit with the brush. There marketing is just a method to fool the customers coz Those who are regular buyer of electric brushes ; they know very well on what kinda brush would help the most."
3.0,April,2023,positive,The product is good but Amazon gave wrong colour
1.0,November,2023,positive,
3.0,April,2023,negative,Should I get it ?
3.0,February,2023,negative,Looks fancy but does not do the job quite well as it doesnt clean deeply. Its an okayish product that i regret buying
2.0,June,2023,negative,"The electric toothbrush I bought was disappointing and not worth the money. It performed poorly, lacked durability, and did not provide the promised superior clean. Considering its high price, I cannot recommend it as a worthwhile investment for effective oral care."
1.0,December,2023,negative,My toothbrush stopped working after 5 months. Battery is totally rusted. Not even working with new battery.
1.0,October,2023,negative,"Okay so this product work better for initial 3 months after that it starts malfunctioning which clearly shows poor quality.Post that now you have to play mail mail with customer service, they will keep asking you for the videos in different ways and delay the process.In the end you will get fed up from the customer service and give up on the product. That's the simple plan."
1.0,October,2023,neutral,Not sure how people are giving 4 to 5 star reviews. May be they have never used an electric toothbrush before. I coming from Philip sonicare and vibration is not even close to 10 % on this toothbrush. It feels I haven’t brushed at all. I’m using this manually which seems and feels better.
3.0,January,2024,positive,Decent product u can try if u want brushing experience is normal like normal brush 3/5 star s s s
1.0,October,2023,negative,Only the brush is vibrating a little.The brush head is not rotating. So it doesn’t work the way like the electric brush. I returned it. They said the money will be refunded. It’s more than five business days and I have not received the refund yet.
2.0,March,2023,negative,I don’t know if it is the issue with unit I received but it doesn’t clean well. I feel the vibration not strong enough to move the brush. Feels like I am just holding brush with humming  sound which is doing nothing l.
1.0,November,2023,negative,"The vibration is not controlled, doesn't bring the effect back to the brush area, the whole body shakes but least impact on the brushing area. Overall it is a very poor quality product"
3.0,July,2022,negative,"I went with the reviews and bought it. However, in comparison to ORAL B, its not that great. ORAL B also comes in thr same proce range but works amazingly.."
3.0,September,2022,neutral,"Have just started using it, not sure on results. But it just vibrates as brush and no impact on teeth"
1.0,August,2023,negative,"Review after usage of 3 months, this toothbrush is not effective at all. While purchasing I thought I will be able maintin more dental hygiene but after using this brush I didn't find it effective. I have switched again to my manual tooth brush and belive me manual toothbrush works better than this."
1.0,November,2023,negative,"Dislike. Bought it for Teeth cleaning/Plague removal. But not worth it. Brush just vibrates, that's it."
1.0,October,2023,positive,Only Looks and Feels great in the have. But when using it the handle seems to vibrate more than the Brush head! LoL!!As useful as a manual toothbrush = next to useless
2.0,April,2022,negative,"The usual ones always prop up on search, but this one, the price and the colour caught my eye. The 30-sec timer, one extra head, and the coupon discount made this a steal deal.Not much headroom to compare but, man oh man, this powerful little thing. Amazing. It massages your gums so well, even the hard-to-reach areas. I have started brushing two times a day now!Update after 5 months, a pure battery drainer now, hardly works for 10 days, the 30secs timer is gone, now have to manually on-off"
1.0,October,2023,negative,Its a bad quality normal toothbrush which only vibrates... In terms of cleaning it does nothing.Cheap plastic peppy colours and packaging.It will look good in your bathroom until touched and used.
1.0,October,2023,positive,The toothbrush didn’t last even for a year; it’s no longer working even if I add a new battery. I used to use it twice a day and always ensured that it didn’t get damaged.
1.0,November,2023,negative,I had bought this last year and it has stopped working in less than a year. Do not recommend.
1.0,November,2023,positive,Its just a vibrating handle and simple soft brush … better go with manual brushes
2.0,February,2023,negative,"A philips Sonic at 20000 vibrations, cleans twice as much. 24,000 does nothing here. Good attempt, but my money wasted. If this is your first sonic, dont waste money"
1.0,October,2023,negative,Kid’s toothbrush. Take oral b instead! This one is just cute lightweight! Not to clean mouth. Handle vibration is more than the brush.
1.0,September,2023,negative,NO USE ! Absolutely WASTE of money! Not an electric brush it just vibrates a little. Highly DISAPPOINTED . Would NOT recommend.Also its for KIDS not adults unlike what it says on amazon
1.0,October,2023,neutral,It's a toy. Not a brush. Don't waste money.
1.0,April,2022,positive,"THIS IS NON-RETURNABLE PRODUCT –How come an electric item can be non-returnable. Beware before you make any purchase decision.......NO ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH EXPERIENCE -I have used an electric toothbrush earlier and bought this product because of it's sleek design. But disappointed with the product after receiving it. this toothbrush doesn’t give you a feel of an electric toothbrush, no rotating bristles, no pressure sensor, no different bristles then normal toothbrush. It’s just a vibrator having normal bristles on top of it, that vibrates when you brush your teeth. no different experience then brushing your teeth with normal toothbrush.NO VALUE FOR MONEY -If you are first time buying an electric toothbrush then buy this one without having any expectations. It is good to showoff but other than its design I don’t see any value in this product."
1.0,October,2023,neutral,The handle vibrates but the bristles doesn't. I have used few other electric Toothbrush but this doesn't serve the purpose at all.
1.0,October,2023,negative,Stopped working in 3 days. No return policy and no after sale service. Waste of money!!
1.0,August,2023,negative,The stocks are really poor. Doesn’t even feelLike it’s an electric toothbrush. Always better to go for a well know brand than trusting any start up who just imports products from China.
3.0,April,2022,negative,Brush is not good for adult its have soft vessel's feel like kids brush vessel
1.0,April,2023,negative,"The quality is so bad, the battery gets drained in 2 days. I have changed the batteries 4 times but after 2 days it just stops working. There is some issue with the toothbrush. It is better to buy food quality known brands than this new one which has got fame just because of coming to a Tv show. Much much better toothbrushes out there than this"
3.0,April,2022,negative,use and throwperfora lavender and yellow DO NOT have brushhead
3.0,August,2022,positive,Good
1.0,January,2023,negative,I had high expectations from using their toothpaste and mouthwash and all that marketing BS.I have been using electric toothbrush from years and used brands like oral b and Agora.This brush vibration is so low. It's feel like using a regular brush. I want to throw it but since I have paid money I am going to use it for atleast a month or two before its going to turn into an e-waste. Probably going to buy oral b electric toothbrush. Not going to take chances on another new startup which are all marketing and no substance.
1.0,October,2023,negative,Brush head is not moving. Is it same with everyone??
1.0,August,2023,negative,I could use it only for 4 months after which it stopped working. Not happy with the quality

1.0,October,2023,neutral,I doesn't clean teeth much
1.0,August,2023,negative,Its stops working i dont know why i have changed the batteries i dont recommend this to anyone. Not happy with this product
2.0,October,2022,negative,The toothbrush only vibrates which is useless considering it does nothing much to clean plaque off teeth.Not worth it.
1.0,May,2023,negative,Bought it as recommended by someone but I really do not understand the purpose of vibration when it doesn’t help in cleaning of teeth. Better to buy Oral-B at price lesser than this and rotating and moving bristles work so well. Not recommended at all.
1.0,April,2023,negative,"Anybody who have used an electronic toothbrush would easily vouch that this is ablsalute crap. Just vibrates ,nothing else.. also the product stopped working and no information on how to claim warranty. Emailed, messaged and no response at all.Stay away and buy from established companies."
1.0,May,2023,positive,
1.0,August,2023,negative,Does not work...and non returnable item...wastage of money dont buy...
1.0,May,2023,positive,
1.0,July,2023,negative,It's only for kids..  no after sale service.. poor quality
1.0,June,2023,negative,Very poor quality toothbrush..Brissels dont vibrate at all..Waste of money..And i cant return it even..
1.0,April,2023,negative,"I have been using electric toothbrush but tried this seeing their ads , it’s horrible the bristle starts wearing away jus after 2 brushesThe vibration on the brush head is not like an oral b . It’s v mildPathetic product"
1.0,July,2023,negative,But the batteries in but the product did not work
1.0,June,2023,neutral,Vibrations are very light . It's okay product not huge difference between 'desi' brush & this electric.meri tarah kisiko paisa barbad karna ho toh khareed lena😁
1.0,July,2023,negative,It’s not effective as shown in add
1.0,April,2023,neutral,"Don't buy, it's just a sound. Manual is much better than this. The vibrator position should be moved close to brush head for real productivity."
1.0,October,2022,negative,The toothbrush is utter waste of money. Its just a gimmick. A fancy looking toothbrush. The vibration motor is really bad. The vibration is so light you cannot even feel it in your mouth. There are many other brands you can find which are much better. Not recommend to buy such product.
1.0,June,2022,negative,"This is just a vibrator and not an electric toothbrush. Please buy from bigger and well known brands than this one. I bought it to support small companies and hoping they put lot of effort in getting things right, but this one ended with me being cheated. On top of this, how can an electronic item be non-refundable ?"
1.0,April,2023,negative,The toothbrush doesn’t work effectively. It’s far inferior to leading electric toothbrush brands like Oral B. Avoid wasting money on this.
2.0,July,2022,negative,The vibration is very low it's not for brushing
1.0,April,2023,positive,brush ke brissles vibrate NAHI hote only handles vibrateWASTE OF MONEY
1.0,May,2022,positive,"Perfora toothbrush build quality, battery backup and waterproofing is really good. Just bought this to experience the sonic electric toothbrush. Sonic tech just feels like a hyped marketing scam. Does not clean properly, normal toothbrush performs better. Happy that I had to spend 699 to realise this instead of spending more than 1000s for other brands."
2.0,September,2022,neutral,No satisfied
1.0,May,2023,negative,THere was no battery provided in the brush. So not happy with it.
1.0,November,2022,positive,
1.0,April,2023,negative,This electric brush has very low vibration strength although its vibration frequency is more than regular electric toothbrushes.
1.0,March,2023,negative,Bakwas chiz banai he wo bhi itni mahangiBrush head not moving around but viberate only like a stupid thing in your mouthDisappointed
3.0,September,2023,positive,Good product at this price. Clean teeth effectively .very light weight. long lasting Battery. aesthetic design and Worth the money
1.0,February,2023,negative,"A very mediocre toothbrush, definitely isn’t worth it. I’d strongly recommend either Oral B or Philips Sonicare instead. There’s plenty of scientific research to back the effectiveness of these brands."
1.0,February,2023,negative,Complete waste of money. This brush does nothing except shivering a bit. It is advised that people only buy circular brush which rotates instead of straight/ regular brush
3.0,September,2023,positive,It creates a lot of froth and does the job well. I will edit the review later for more. Thank you
1.0,March,2023,positive,It looks good but the bristles don't move at all...only vibrating tool....gimmick product...u have to use it like normal brush only
3.0,September,2023,positive,Small bezzels feels good in mouthExtremely handy unlike other electric toothbrushes which are so big in sizeOver-all a good product
1.0,August,2022,negative,Absolutely low quality. Only vibrates at such low speed. Lol it's a toy or what. Truly very very bad purchase. Cannot even exchange now. Dont buy. You will waste full amt.
