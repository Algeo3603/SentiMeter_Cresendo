3.0,February,2024,negative,"I am reviewing this after using it for 8 months. My experience is mixed. Its sleek design is attractive and battery life is good. With usage of daily once , till now I have charged it only once after first 3 months.However the sound level has tremendously increased after 3 months even in the slow option. With the brush head fixed, the sound is high enough to be an irritant. The USP of Sonicare being silence, I didn’t find it to be true.Also, the feature of brush head replacement warning didn’t happen even once. Not sure if this feature actually exists even if claimed"
1.0,January,2024,negative,"Please dont buy, the replacement heads are so expensive. 1200rs per piece and can use only 3 months. Check the replacement brush head price before you buy."
3.0,November,2022,negative,"Hello, After having used for six months without any problem, Now I notice that it's vibratory action has stopped though battery is fine and vibration noice is herad and felt but brush bristels  doesn't vibrate. I request the seller to advise me to how to go about this issue."
3.0,August,2022,positive,"The brush vibrates powerfully that could help clean the years old yellow stain. Unfortunately, the brush does not spin or move. At this price, I was expecting it to perform better. Battery life is good, it can last anywhere between 2 weeks to 4 weeks depending upon the usage. Ergonomic is also superb. Original brush head replacement is also expensive. My overall rating 3 star."
3.0,August,2022,negative,It was difficult for me to start using because it brings with it very strong sensations due to strong vibrations - often very ticklish. Almost feel like I'm on a dentist's chair. Don't feel excited to pick it up to brush.
