1.0,November,2023,negative,The toothbrush doesn’t charge ! After keeping it on charge for a few hours it only works 15 seconds and stops every single time. There is no light on the charger to know if it’s even charging or not. Absolute waste of money
3.0,October,2023,neutral,"This toothbrush dies just around weekend.No led or any indication of low battery, it just dies.Charging is slow but no indicator so you have to assume its charging.a good product ruined by charging and battery issues"
3.0,February,2024,positive,"Doesn't have any indicator for battery, is waterproof and motor is strong. More features could have been added at this price point. But for quality I would recommend."
3.0,January,2024,neutral,There is no charging indicator
2.0,February,2024,positive,Bought it in November 2023 and writing the review in Feb 2024. So yeah used it well before commenting.It’s a good electric tooth brush with 2 modes. Costlier compared to other available ones.Cons: no charging indicator. So you have no idea how many hours you need to chargeThe replacement heads cost rs.500 per pair and it lasts for 2 months.So the strategy is sell the brush at 1500 and charge 250 per month for replacement heads.Definitely wouldnt recommend.
2.0,December,2023,negative,"PROS: The toothbrush does it's basic job. Cleans well, gets into those hard to reach places and does make a an overall difference in hygiene. All this would be GREAT if the toothbrush actually WORKED. Read the cons and the final verdict.CONS: To say the battery life is pathetic would be an UNDERSTATEMENT. It BARELY lasts for two uses on a full charge, after which the power of motor is so low you might as well use a manual toothbrush. THERE IS NO LED INDICATOR LIGHT TO TELL YOU IF ITS CHARGED OR NOT. How long it takes to charge is literally anybody's guess. The charging base has a ridiculously tiny chord. And the base itself CONSTANTLY topples over. The icing on the cake is that after about a month, the toothbrush stopped charging altogether.FINAL VERDICT: EFFICIENT BRUSH WITH TERRIBLE BATTERY, TERRIBLE DESIGN, STOPPED WORKING AFTER A MONTH."
3.0,August,2023,negative,Toothbrush did a decent job of cleaning however it stopped working after a year of use.The only negative of the toothbrush is the lack of a charging light combined with a proprietary charger. If your battery is dead there's no way of telling if it's charging other than checking it after an hour or so
3.0,September,2023,neutral,"The modes are less compared to others on the market and the vibration that lets you know about the 4 quadrants is less noticeable against others. Also, there is no charging light indicator."
3.0,August,2023,negative,The electric brush has stopped working exactly after 1month of purchase!I want to get a replacement .yESTERDAY THE SELLER HAS GOT IN TOUCH WITH ME AND SUGGETED A VOUCHER IN LIEU OF REPLACEMENT WHICH I HAVE AGREED TO.AWAITING DEVELOPMENTS FROM THEM NOW.
3.0,September,2023,negative,It stopped recharging in two months of use !!
3.0,September,2023,positive,Battery finishes too soonOtherwise all good
3.0,September,2023,neutral,Doesn't feel comfortable to use.
1.0,January,2024,negative,"paid 1500 rupees, died within 3 months, bought in october, stopped working in january mid. and not just this one, another one i bought for m y son - oral b vitality 100. erratic working initially, you think it is loose contact. then plain dead.. then it suddenly starts up ! and dies again. ..they dont make the battery any good in this! .. never again."
1.0,February,2024,negative,"Battery stopped working after a week, unable to return or replace the brush."
1.0,December,2023,negative,"After 3months of using stopped working, and there is 2 yrs of warranty so i tried to call there customer care number many times and they will answer it and told me they will send link to send the picture waited but no use. Later i mailed them no reply. After paying this much amount it's too bad and I never expected an Oral-B-like product to be like this."
1.0,February,2024,neutral,Not working it’s been only 2 days. No replacement warranty. No customer care number. Can anyone help?
3.0,July,2023,positive,
1.0,January,2024,negative,The brush stopped working in 2 days. Despite or charging it does not work. Would NOT recommend this product.
1.0,January,2024,negative,Poor product pls replace it if (seller) sees it
3.0,October,2021,negative,"Previously I used Oral B cross battery required brush for more than 2 years and planned to upgrade to this. This brush is expensive than B cross model. I saw many comments and details about rotating brushes with this model. Hence went for this.  However, the brush just twists a little bit like Oral B cross model and won't make any circular rotation. The replacement head is also expensive compared to B cross model. The rechargeable battery used in B cross model last me up to 2 months. This costly model will last up to 6 days with an in-built battery. The charging also requires 16 hours. Hence it will be inconvenient if the brush is dead before recharging. One needs to keep a  regular backup brush :-)I don't see much benefit in upgrading to this double-priced model versus my old B cross model."
2.0,September,2023,positive,"It works good but no display for chargingChanging ho raha hai ya nhi,pata nhi chalta. Bahut time to brush krte samay bich me hi band hota hai..need more facilities"
1.0,January,2024,neutral,No battery back don’t purchase this item and no return and refund policy
3.0,July,2022,negative,At ghist price the device and charger does not have led to indicate if the charger is working or the device button is On Or Off. If the battery dies and you put the device on charger and forget to turn off the device it will not charge and you will realize after 1 -2 hrs or if the charger is not working then know way to realize. In this age a led costs nothing and it is implied that a device will have such indicators. Either the designer were in experienced or oral-b wants u to waste your money
1.0,November,2023,neutral,I really hoped seller had put some picture of cord length and mentioned total length of cord. These things are necessary when you buying product online and that too with non refundable option.Also not sure why Amazon allowing almost everything in India as non refundable or very limited replacement window when we are paying almost equivalent of US prices for product.Oral b selling same product in US with charging cord almost 25% longer
3.0,June,2023,positive,Good power but misses led indicator while charging
3.0,May,2023,negative,It's not working whom should I contract?
3.0,November,2022,positive,"With an only positive that the brush head rotates, this is overpriced. This review is coming after 10 months of usage and changing the brush head once. Few cons: Poor battery life, no charging or battery status indicator, high priced brush heads, long charging time. Good option if you have extremely sensitive teeth. Else there are better options."
2.0,August,2023,positive,THIS IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED. THERE ONLY ONE BRUSH. THERE IS NO TIMING MECHANISM ON THE BRUSH. ONCE IT STARTS IT CONTINUES ON WITHOUT ANY STOP.
1.0,January,2024,negative,The brush did't charge. Not sure whether brush or charger is defective.
1.0,November,2023,negative,"Disappointed. cant even return the item... absolute scam, stay away from this item. Works for 1 week, then the charger does not charge it. brush head doesnt spin anymore.Update:Tried charging it with my old Oral B - charger pad, still no luck.Amazon should seriously remove this product. After going back through the other reviews i am disappointed i didn't read them first."
1.0,December,2023,negative,You should charge it for 16hours straight after which you can use it for 2 mins in 8days..i mean what nonsense.....i wish i could return it well in time
1.0,September,2023,positive,
1.0,January,2024,negative,battery dead in few months only
3.0,December,2022,positive,The amazon website clearly indicates that country of origin is Hungary.  The delivered product is made in china.
3.0,March,2023,negative,Not useful. Traditional is better..!!
2.0,July,2023,negative,It reduces the rotation speed gradually month by month and after certain period it's not getting charged only
1.0,December,2023,neutral,Disappointed experience. The brush is not switching on after two days of use.
2.0,May,2023,negative,I Liked the way it cleans your teethBut no way to understandHow much battery is remainingWhen put on charging u do not understand if it’s charging or notIf it’s full or notLots of inconvenience
2.0,June,2023,positive,"I wanted charging/ low charge ,indicator Electric toothbrush ,hence I wants to return Oral B Vitaliy Electric Toothbrush received today, pl advice me can this be returned"
3.0,December,2022,negative,Disappointed that it has no charging indicator and wondering if I can get spare brushes! The box cover wasn’t sealed and looked old
1.0,December,2023,negative,waste of money
3.0,August,2022,positive,"The product is good, But the no indicator for ""battery low / fully charged"" is a negative point. My previous brush from the same manufacturer had these indicators."
2.0,December,2022,negative,"Solid design. Works wellCleans well too ( I assume )But very very noisyCharge won't go beyond exactly 6 or 7 days ( my partner's realme sonic have passed a month with first charging, still working )No charging indicating light.No cover for the brush.Now Stopped working after 5 months.I won't recommend this, but this is the only rotating brush option at this budget.May be oral b higher versions may be good"
1.0,January,2024,positive,
3.0,May,2022,positive,"All thing is good but main point is batry backup is only 4 to 5 time use after changing 8 hour and no indicator of chargeing or discharging , battery back is make feel for not using electronic brush when it is stop in meantime teething. Brush"
1.0,November,2023,negative,The brush stopped working less than eleven days of buying. Absolute  waste of money. Kindly refrain from buying.
1.0,August,2023,negative,"It was working fine in the beginning, but once charged...it couldn't last even for couple of minutes. It stopped working. I bought two and faces same issue with both. By the time this problem arose, Amazon couldn't help. Had to reach out to oral b customer support which is such a time taking process. Highly disappointed."
3.0,May,2021,positive,"No indication of charging or charged, no light or sound, so you don't know when it's fully charged. There is no protective cover for bristles. Battery life checked is good enough for 10 to 23 cycles. The other my previous model Cross Action with non chargeable Battery is much better on all respects and one AA battery is good for couple of months."
3.0,June,2021,negative,"It automatically turns on sometimes. Also, the charge wouldn’t last even for a second time use at times.Edit: Upon some Google searches, I realised that it is happening because somehow water has reached the circuit board causing the power button to act up. So, be careful while using the product.Except for this it is a wonderful brush."
2.0,October,2022,negative,"It's the most basic electric toothbrush. Doesn't charge well, there's no indicator to show less charge. It just abruptly stops. The charger doesn't have an indicator as well, you don't know if it's charging or not. Left it on charge for 12+ hours, only to realise it didn't charge at all, it's like throwing a dice and hoping for a 6. Not worth the price, there are better options from other brands"
3.0,July,2022,positive,Oral b is very good brand for brush and its my 2nd brush and results are good. Product is good for battery backup and smoothly experience.
1.0,November,2023,neutral,Battery is not loger time it's always want to charge after 2 minit use
1.0,November,2023,neutral,"Stopped working after 1year, has no replacement after this period."
3.0,December,2021,neutral,"It's feels like a mouth spa after brushing with this. Cleaning is normal, but it definitely massages the gums and teeth.No indicator for low battery, or when on charging. Also at this price, extra brush should be given."
1.0,November,2023,negative,Charger indicator to know the batt % . Cleaning not effective .
1.0,October,2023,negative,"The product stopped working just inside of a month, like it just died. Tried contacting the brand but got no response from their end. Wouldn't recommend this product."
1.0,November,2023,negative,Charger does not work . Cannot return. Money down the drain.
1.0,November,2023,negative,The toothbrush has stopped working after 20 days
2.0,May,2022,negative,"Hi Guys,Writing this review after using it for a month. I feel, overall it has good teeth cleaning ability. But what shocks me most is the battery life and charging indication. Battery life is around 10-15 mins on a single charge, which is low. There's absolutely no indication for charging. I must have broke my head 100 times to know whether the brush is getting charged. Even the charging instrument is poor.Recommendation: No. Better look for more advance toothbrush that has a better battery life and charging indicators."
1.0,August,2023,negative,DO NOT BUY THIS TOOTHBRUSH. This item does not recharge when you plug it in. Disgusting and pathetic product from Oral B.Amazon not ready to replace this product. Stick to Colgate. I will never by anything from Amazon again 🙏
3.0,December,2021,negative,The outer case had a tear as if someone has already opened this and then resealed it hastily. Now I'm not sure if this is a used/ returned product or not. Gross.
3.0,August,2022,positive,
1.0,October,2023,neutral,It stopped working after 1 week of use. The brush head doesnt move anymore. And it never shows the 2 mins timer light. Worst product.

3.0,April,2022,negative,"Cleans well but causes pain, may be due to hardness of brissles. They should be softer. Rest all good."

1.0,August,2023,neutral,Hi I bought this product via Amazon on Aug 1st.Now it is not charging.
1.0,September,2022,negative,The battery lasts for hardly 7 brushes. The auto timer which tells to change sides does not work. It does the job good. The bristles started to worn out after usage for 2 weeks. Didn't expect a product like this from a reputed company like Oral B. Pathetic product and no return window.Edit as on Sep 2022:-Bought this product on August 14. Product not charging and dead on October 2. Didn't expect this quality from a reputed company like Oral B.
2.0,January,2023,positive,
