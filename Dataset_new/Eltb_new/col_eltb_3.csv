1.0,July,2022,negative,"This product is dangerous to use. It is not good for maintaining healthy gum. It vibrates so fast that it hurt my gum and teeth. It can damage your teeth and gum. Oral b battery powered toothbrush was my first electric toothbrush and it was very good. This Colgate sonic toothbrush is waste of money. I suggest to buy rotating - oscillating toothbrush of oral b company, not any vibratory sonic toothbrush. I hope that it will help."
3.0,September,2022,positive,I have to charge my toothbrush every 15-20 days. The Caresmith toothbrush battery lasts for 3 months!!
1.0,December,2022,negative,"The brush lasted only 8 months. I had bought it in May 2022, In Dec 2022 it is broken.The brush doesn't switch on. First I thought its because of battery, even after charging for more than 10 hours, it doesn't turn on.Looks like the panel is damaged.8 month's life for such expensive product is not acceptable."

2.0,March,2022,negative,"Having used other generic Sonic toothbrushes, this model was a let down... Annoyingly loud, cheap plastic feel... I bought only because the replacement brush heads were easily available but cleaning is average"
1.0,December,2022,negative,This brush hurts the teeth. It does not give a smooth brushing exprerience. It feels like so much pressure is put on teeth with an unplesaant sound and feeling in the gums and teeth after brushing.It is better to go for Oral B or Philips
2.0,April,2022,negative,Common guys make the on and off button sensitive. You need to gym to press the off button.  Can't even return.
