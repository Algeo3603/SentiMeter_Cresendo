1.0,September,2023,neutral,The battery just gave up after a month. The product initially worked fine but now it barely lasts 2 minutes no matter how much i charge it. Please don’t buy from amazon as the return policy is not available after a month.
3.0,June,2023,positive,"So I purchased this a week ago, it was a very weird experience for the first day as it was my first time using an electric toothbrush, after that i kinda Started liking it, although i purchased this because it had Pressure Sensor which i thought might be helpful if in case I put too much pressure.But it requires too much pressure for it to activate, and most probably no one brushes their teeth like this!So instead i will suggest people to buy Philis toothbrush but cheaper one( Yes i know it gives more strokes but well now it's upto you do decide what you want )"
3.0,January,2023,positive,The brush is good. However Philips strangely does not sell the brush head replacements online or offline. It’s strange and annoying.Their customer care is also pretty clueless about the whole thing which adds to the mess.
2.0,June,2023,negative,I found this brush vibrating too much. The whole system just vibrates. Very inconvenient. Accindentaly the back side plastic sometimes touches the teeth and it hurts. Gums hurt. I don't know why people are writing so positive about this product . 2 star is enough.
1.0,November,2023,neutral,No speed or pressure control. Can damage to teeths.no return policy. Don't waste money.
2.0,June,2022,negative,"I bought this product on my dentist recommendation. The very disturbing fact is saliva splashing while brushing. Moreover, two minutes is just not sufficient for brushing the teeth. We can switch on again the brush but i don't understand how for each quadrant 30 seconds is sufficient. I find brushing the teeth in normal brush is more comfortable than this electric brush. Let me see after repeated use I might get used to it. Otherwise the product seems fine. Not sure if I had to take a round brush."
1.0,June,2022,negative,"The product is plain simple ineffective. After using it for a good month and a half or so, I still find plaque on my teeth . I have to manually clean my teeth everyday because the brush just isn’t effective. The only reason I still use it is because it was so expensive else would’ve binned it much earlier. Funnily enough I had to invest in buying a charger for it too. Seems like Philips pulled the scam of the century here. They should be ashamed because they’ve lost a customer that uses so many Philips products and has been a loyal customer for more than 16 years now from when I bought my first trimmer on turning a teenager. Good job Philips. How to lose your loyal customer in 1 product."

1.0,March,2023,positive,"The product itself is excellent, definitely 5 STAR.But NO replacement head is available anywhere. I have tried all major online platforms and a few Phillipes retail stores. But No clue where to find it in India. A few options on Amazon are more expensive than the whole Brush assembly itself. And some non-genuine options are also available but I don't want to take risks with my teeth."
3.0,May,2022,positive,"How long-lasting, only time can tell"
1.0,April,2023,positive,"The brush is good, got refill once and was around 1200 for pack of 2, now can't even find them and the only listing is 6k for pack of 5 I couldn't get the replacement in my local offline market. Please check availability of replacement heads before purchasing."
1.0,April,2022,negative,The title of the review suffice itself what I meant to say.. It may be the product I received is defective.. Have attached pics of water getting fluttered so strong.. Using the toothbrush my teeth is shaking so much that after use I have to check whether they are still in place or not..
