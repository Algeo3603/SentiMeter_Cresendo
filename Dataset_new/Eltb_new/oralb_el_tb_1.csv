3.0,January,2024,negative,"Oral B tooth brush is good if it works but durability is not good . I have changed nearly 4 brushes in 1 year and also replaced the brush heads , The issue is either the water gets inside the battery compartment and rust forms in the terminals  and stops working and the buttons are like alien it works some times and it works when u throw it .Advantage is u can change the AA Battery and keep using it not required to charge  ."
1.0,May,2022,negative,"TLDR: If you are thinking of buying this then DON'T, a normal tooth brush will provide better cleaning than this toy. If you want to buy an electric tooth brush save up and go for the proper Pro line, it really does provide a better cleaning vs manual brushes even with proper techniques especially along the gum line.Full ReviewThis toy does not come even remotely close to the performance of the proper electric oral b brush.My pro 600 is now old so the battery does not last long so I thought to try this battery toothbrush since it also has a rotating head but the difference in performance is night and day.The battery toothbrush motor does not have enough torque to prevent it from slowing down the moment even the slightest pressure is applied and I mean very little pressure like trying to clean the wisdom teeth on upper jaw, the head is too big and bulky for easy maneuvering. The low torque also does not clean the teeth surface well.The whole point of the electric brush is to clean more effectively with more strokes per second, you just glide it along the teeth with next to no regular brushing motion and the rotation and pulsing of the brush head does a thorough cleaning. This toy does not have the rotation speed to clean just by spinning and you have to do the manual moving of brush like a regular brush which IMO defeats the whole purpose.Avoid the battery toy. If you want to buy an electric toothbrush just save up for a proper one, no need to go for higher models costing 5-6k buy the entry one its performance is same for basic cleaning and it performs just as well as the more expensive ones. All it lacks is the fancy modes that change the pulsating speed of the brush head. Those modes don't really add any value to the teeth cleaning.The quality of bristles is also higher on the pro line of brushes they don't start to fray or disintegrate at the speed of cheaper manual brushes. This battery brush has less dense bristles and they also feel lower quality. The pic shows a Pro 600 brush head that is over 1 year old vs a new battery brush with 1 use on it."
3.0,February,2024,neutral,"Expensive brushes by Oral B, 2000/- for two brushes still no case, cover or travel case is being provided by the company."
3.0,January,2024,negative,"This is basically a ""false advertising"" from this brand... The timer is not available on this brush... It will never work... If it was available I would've given 5 star. That's an L."
3.0,February,2024,positive,It's very good liked the product cleans tooth very nicely....
3.0,January,2024,neutral,ToothBrush battery didn't last even for two months though I am using it once a days usually others brush battery last for six month atleast.
3.0,January,2024,negative,Product ke andar ka packet broken tha
3.0,September,2023,negative,"While this is no doubt value for money, I have used the other Oral B Vitality 100 model as well.Comparison1. The Vitality model is almost 2.5 times the price but worth it2. This model creates a lot of noise and vibrations,It has two sets of cleaning brushes, one is supposed to rotate and other vibrate. Hence the noise and extreme vibrations. On the other hand Vitality 100 has just a rotary round brush3.The rotatory part of brush is the main cleaning brush and in this model, it stops rotating as soon as you apply even a little pressure for a better clean. This is hard to realise that this has stopped  since there is lot of vibration from other part of the brush - resulting in poorer cleaning.The Vitality model however does the job very well and the rotor doesn't stop so easily - it continues to rotate and scrub the tooth surface.4. The overall head size of this model is too big for comfort esp for teenagers. On the other hand - Vitality 100 is absolutely perfectMy verdict - go for Vitality 100 if you don't mind spending 2.5x the amount - but it's worth the extra."
2.0,February,2024,negative,Review after 6 months of usage . Better not buy this one because the major drawback is it is not rechargeable. You have to change the battery s within 20 days . If it is Duracell then it will last a bit more . The battery will cost 25 rupees for 25 days and for 2 brush head cost 490 rupees . There is a duplicate (8 for 490) option but it is very slow which won't give a proper cleaning. At first we feel like it's a great deal but it's not .
3.0,November,2023,negative,The product performs as promised or expected.However there is no user manual especially for its maintenance and upkeep.What is worrying is that the tooth paste foam trickles down to the handle which houses the batteries.This creates a worry on how to clean the unit without the watertrickling into the battery housing leading to a short circuit.
3.0,December,2023,positive,good but ok ok
3.0,November,2023,negative,"Ease of use is not the great. At the time of brushing, foam which is in the mouth comes out on the brush, it feels messy!"
2.0,February,2024,positive,The Brush's mexhanism is good and unique and I liked how it cleaned. But the motor and parts are extremely poor quality. I have bought 2 and bothe have stopped functioning. Sad how good design has been brought down by poor quality parts.
3.0,November,2023,positive,Too bulky
3.0,October,2023,positive,"It’s best in the price rangeCleans well, easy to change the top.But it’s bit noisy and vibrations are bit high when you are brushing it affects.Rest it all about the budget.."
2.0,January,2024,negative,I put  new batteries in the tooth brush but it stops and does not work. Sometimes when I shake it vigorously it does start but stops again. I would like a replacement or I can buy a better one and pay the difference.
2.0,January,2024,negative,"The vibration on my brush has become very sluggish after around 3-4 months use. Thinking it's the battery, I changed to a new Duracell and it was the same. Tried another battery too but still the same. It's so sluggish that the moment I put it on my teeth, it simply grinds to a halt. Now I'm going to try their costlier model, the Pro 1000 with the hope that it will work."
2.0,February,2024,positive,product is good but normal brush is batter then dis and clean batter then this brush so not worth it at all
3.0,August,2023,negative,I used it. Battery dead. And now I am back to my simple toothbrush. Guess it was just a phase to try a different kind of toothbrush.Why waste money in this .It is better to buy a tooth brush made from eco friendly materials like bamboo or simply use Datun. This item is sort of a gimmick. You will use it when it's new and then you will go back to ur regular brush. So buy it if you have an itch to spend money. Haha
2.0,February,2024,negative,Battery not properly work.didnt brushed properly.. only two three months.i was purchased .not worked.
2.0,July,2023,negative,"This is my second oral b criss cross. The last one lasted a couple of months back in 2015. This new one lasted hardly a week.First let me clarify, this isn't a rotating head, it turns slightly back and forth that's all, the bottom one just moves back and forth it's not that great since u use the round head to work around the teeth for the most part, brush works good at cleaning when the head is at an angle only, basically vibrates, the vibrations were strong enough to clean and remove stain marks at the start, it started getting stuck in between the tooth gaps and the pulsations stop when that happens u have to ease the slightest amount of pressure to get it back into action. I thought maybe a weak Chinese battery and changed to a Duracell, resumed working like new again just for a day . Until it completely stopped vibrating. Head just stops any action whatsoever at the slightest pressure . Disappointed wanted it to work atleast for a couple of months . Go for Sonic toothbrushes with twist removable heads, this one's a pain to get the head swapped. Maybe it's just my unit that was faulty , but nostalgia says otherwise since it failed the same way.Got it around the 350₹ range .My honest advice spend a little bit more and get something more reliableHappy shopping"
2.0,January,2024,negative,It makes more noise than cleaning teeth.
3.0,August,2023,positive,
3.0,October,2023,negative,Leads to dental problems
1.0,February,2024,negative,The round and vibrating motion both does nothing for my teeth . The front rotates at high velocity hence barely touching teeth and back part is not engaging at all . Total waste of money . I prefer Colgate charcoal over it . It’s vibrating only but cleanses like freshly done scaling procedure .
2.0,October,2023,negative,"I won't recommend this brush to anyone. Mine stopped working within two weeks since I bought it. I think the battery compartment was not waterproof and when I checked there were water droplets inside. I tried drying it and switching on again but the brush remained dead. Only good thing happened is when I asked for warranty claim, the company responded positively and offered me a gift voucher of same amount. However I bought a rechargeable brush with that voucher, additionally paying some more money."
1.0,February,2024,negative,"Ordered this for my 87 year old mom, put the batteries but it does not work. Tried to return but says this is not eligible for returns. Piece costs Rs. 1000 and no returns. This is ridiculous."
3.0,March,2023,negative,"So, I recently tried this and I have to say, my teeth have felt more sensitive. This toothbrush is rusting from the inside. I mean, I knew I needed to up my iron intake, but this is getting ridiculous.But hey, at least the two-minute timer works.In all seriousness, it isn't the worst toothbrush I've ever used. It gets the job done, even if it's not exactly gentle on my pearly whites. Just make sure to keep it dry and clean to avoid the rust situation."
1.0,February,2024,positive,It worked fine for about 3months and then it would stop in between and make a long beep. I tried changing battery but I'm facing the same problem yet again.
1.0,January,2024,negative,"I think I absolutely wasted my money on this toothbrush. The brush stopped functioning properly after 3-4 uses. Instead of vibrating at its usual frequency, it gets stuck and wobbles. It didn't matter even when the battery is of high quality and totally new. Waste of money."
3.0,June,2023,positive,"It's good for the price but, you know the delivery experience is awful, it got delayed and even delayed it by a day, but still though the features are on another level for the price."
1.0,February,2024,negative,Faulty product delivered. Matter informed to Amazon on customer care on same day. Amazon assured refund but same is not received till today.
2.0,November,2023,positive,"The mechanism is good, but the bristles are very hard. It makes my gums bleed. This brush is definitely not for me."
3.0,June,2023,negative,"Yesterday I purchased, after following all the instructions,the product was not working, lastly I changed the batteries,it worked. Very very poor batteries 😞."
1.0,February,2024,neutral,The toothbrush timer is not at all working. And it’s non refundable. So it’s better buy from out side
1.0,February,2024,negative,Its dead now after 1 and a half years of usage. Colgate sonic brush is better which is older than Oral B and is still functional.
3.0,May,2023,positive,Not working properly after 1 month . May be my piece is defective but .. not expecting those defective pieces from Oral B or Amazon . I have to admit during first month I have seen good results .
3.0,March,2023,positive,The brush is good in terms of its bristle lasting longer and the motor working even now. But the holding rubber starts melting on its own and then the motor starts  working only when you set it in a certain way. If they could've improved the holding rubber of better quality to protect the motor inside the brush could be more durable to use.
1.0,February,2024,negative,I now have to hold the button continuously to brush. Annoying.
3.0,March,2023,negative,Not as good i expected. Better go for a premium category with small brush head. This ones head is too big.  It just vibrates. No effective.  U have to use it more like a normal brush.
3.0,July,2023,neutral,Doesn't give results like the traditional 30-50 Rs. Toothbrushes.
1.0,November,2023,negative,PLEASE CLICK HELPFUL SO IT REACHES OUT TO EVERYONEI've been using perfora brush which was just vibrating and nothing else so later I tried this brush and due to hard vibrations and extreme pressure it created after a week usage of the brush now my teeth are suffering a lot and I'm in lot of pain daily. I'm actually very careful about teeth but my baddest decision in life to use this brush led me to loose Enamel layer and Gums loosening. Please guys don't use it. Use super soft or soft bristles only. The one's which come with this brush are not just hard but super hard.
1.0,January,2024,negative,"Brush head rotation is inconsistent, ratation slows down after 15-20 seconds and does not offer good cleaning. This problem started after 2 months of use."
3.0,July,2023,positive,Good excercise for mouth.
3.0,March,2023,positive,"I liked this brush because it is good as it's price it is the cheapest electric toothbrush in the market and the best thing is I got batteries on it , it makes my teeth too white."
1.0,February,2024,negative,It stopped working.
1.0,February,2024,neutral,Doesn't actually rotate
2.0,November,2023,negative,Product does not work
3.0,April,2023,positive,Product is good but after few months battery drain very fast we have to change battery at every 10 days
3.0,September,2017,positive,"•Firstly, you may think that this electric brush has a spinning round head and vibraring flat brush. That's not true. The round head rotates to and fro through around 10 - 20° angle rapidly. And the flat brush vibrates in to and fro in one plane.•Now, about the cleaning performance. It's below average.~The round head functions well. If we try to stop it from vibrating with our finger, it still resists and keeps vibrating.~The flat part though, it stops vibrating even with a slight pressure on the top. So in your mouth, don't expect anything but the round part to work properly.This is when the battery power is full. When the battery begins to wear off, the vibrations become weak and the cleaning ability becomes worse.*Using the brush*- I brush like normal with the vibrations assisting in the cleaning process. A lot of vibrations go to the entire brush so not much goes to the brush head. It's more of a massage to your hand. Also the brush head is larger than non electric brushes so it's going to be a large fit in the mouth.~>I found myself shift back to a normal brush after using this for a month. I spend longer using this electric brush, and don't get any advantage. Plus it's very noisy. Sounds like a dirt motorcyle engine.•Unless you want to show off, continue using a manual brush. Or else, buy a more expensive electric toothbrush that actually works. This is just a gimmick mechanism in my opinion. It's good. But not practical.PLEASE SHOW YOUR APPRECIATION FOR MY REVIEW BY PRESSING THE *helpful* BUTTON. THANK YOU :)"
1.0,January,2024,neutral,Not to purchase to lower Colette
1.0,January,2024,negative,Battery life is zilch !!!!
1.0,January,2024,negative,I have ordered two brush one is working fine another is not working...even quality is very poor
3.0,February,2023,negative,"While they advise to replace head once in every 3 months, they provide only one head and replacement heads are not available"
2.0,June,2022,negative,I have used this toothbrush for 25 days and for the first 10 days i am using very carefully applying very less pressure and even after brushing for 4 min my teeth are not even clearing before that when I was using my normal brush it was far more better than that this electric brush has hard bristle it does not have an rotation speed and vibration controller It does not also clean the area where teeth are placed curved if u want to clean than u have to apply more pressure so that bristle can reach the place where u want to clean and due to this u will see in some time your teeth enamel is becoming light transparent type so be carefull using it if u apply light pressure then it will not clean and If u apply more pressure it will lead enemal damage so my suggestion go for some expensive one or use your normal toothbrush and always use soft bristles toothbrush so if u apply high pressure it will not effect your teeth enamel
2.0,June,2023,positive,The system is good. Worked for 3-4 days. But then one day I wake up and the brush is running on automatically. Probably some problem with the button. But now its gone. So yes will work good for 3-4 days but then no one knows!
3.0,February,2023,positive,Product is fine works well. After doing online search bought this. Just very noisy though.
2.0,September,2023,negative,It is not work it and it is too slow and and it turning of itself in Charging full
3.0,April,2023,negative,Stopped working. Disappointed. Too costly.
1.0,December,2023,negative,I found the product to be absolute rubbish. It vibrates to the extent that its regular use may perhaps weaken your teeth !!!
1.0,November,2023,negative,"The brush and the brush rod is very bulky and the whole experience is just bad , and it’s very noisy!!If I couldn’t would have returned it, completely dissatisfied. Never again an oral B"
3.0,February,2022,positive,"If you want to get started with an electric toothbrush and get some idea about it you can start with this entry level brush. Cleanliness is ok, freshness feel is a bit down compared to regular toothbrush. Been using this for barely a week so can't say much about battery life. Brush head motion is not spiral it vibrates to and fro, so a bit let down in this. Overall seems to be a ok product, can be considered for a trial."
1.0,October,2023,positive,
1.0,December,2023,negative,My experience with this brush was very very poor it's just a waste of money
1.0,September,2023,negative,"Writing this review after using it fot 5 days.It stopped working on 6th day.Changed the battery to fix the issue. IT IS NOT WORKING.Contacted Amazon customer care. They asked me to contact manufacturer. 3 phone numbers were provided to contact the manufacturer.It says first one is invalid.Second one is switched off.And on third one till now I have tried multiple calls, no one is answering."

2.0,September,2023,negative,Not good product worst of money
2.0,August,2023,negative,"It does the job,but electric brush should sound like a bullet,Avoid."
1.0,December,2023,negative,I bought it in July and it stopped working in November...wats the use of spending money on something that will work only for 4 mths
3.0,March,2023,positive,Good
3.0,November,2022,neutral,Review after a week usage. Battery life ia great. Only issue is it says the head rotates but it doesn't rotate. It just vibrates. Looks like rotating but doesn't.
3.0,March,2023,positive,
1.0,October,2023,negative,The brush stopped working in just less than a month. I had a previous Oral B toothbrush which did the same thing. This is a very inferior product due to its pathetic reliability. Please stay off it. Now I am wondering how to get it replaced.
1.0,December,2023,negative,The timer button is not working … you have to hold the start for it to work continuously
3.0,March,2022,negative,It was a decent brush but battery powered with this price doesn’t make senseIt makes a huge noise while brushingMore over it hurta when the plastic part touches the teethCan buy electric sonic brushes which dont make much sound and easier to recharge instead of replacing batteries
1.0,December,2023,negative,"Very noisy electric brush, almost gives headache"
3.0,October,2022,positive,Its good but for old people its difficult to on and off.The brush bristles should be a bit strong.But good.
3.0,December,2022,negative,Not suitable for daily use. The bristles are too hard.
2.0,August,2021,positive,"1 Year Usage Review :I have been using this electric brush for the past year now. (Have been thinking of writing this review  and changing the brush since long)The top head rotates (well practically move clockwise and anticlockwise) which is a good thing. The bottom bristles has front-backward motion. Overall (if it work properly) this combination works wonders.Slighted thicker top.The AA Duracell batteries last about a couple of months.The brush head stop moving after lets say a week or two. The bottom part will still work but the rotating head will stop the movement.You may think you have to change the head as you may have damaged the same but wait that's not the issue. You change the head it works for a week and stop working, again.Now you may think of changing the batteries but that too won't help out.Order new heads and the results were same. THE HEAD WON'T MOVE.It worked great until it worked but after the first head started giving problem it never worked like it should have been."
3.0,March,2020,positive,"It is a good product if you have never used it and good to show off too!but it cannot be a direct substitute for your regular toothbrush.It could replace regular toothbrush only when it has thinner base & longer bristles like regular tooth brush,.the thick base makes it difficult for the brush to reach the grinders at the Far end and this makes it uncomfortable to use and in turn using this toothbrush becomes more time consuming than a regular  tooth brush...Again the brush end has some open places showing the rods that help in the vibration when are difficult to clean after each use and raises a question of hygiene. All in all good to show off but not good for day to day morning / evening usage."
1.0,November,2023,negative,"It is vibration brush and useless, waste of money.  I purchased on the understanding, it is rotating brush. Hopeless product."
3.0,June,2022,negative,"I used it for 6 months, gave up and back to normal brush as my teeth quality detoriated..again its person to person but my personal advice use ur own muscle to clean your own bones."
1.0,November,2023,negative,The product stopped working within a week of uasge and amazon refused to help at all. Never buy it
3.0,November,2020,neutral,"This is classic example of consumerism. Practically this brush solves a purpose but if you use it, you would realize that you don't actually need it. It doesn't lessen your efforts to brush. It doesn't go deeper into hidden areas as freely as simple brushes. It take more time to clean teeth with this. One thing it does is gum massage due to vibration but prolonged use results into numbness. Practically I don't feel any extra advantage. It has 10 times less bristles fibres with 10 time more price. Best practice of brushing1. Pea size paste only.2. Brushing time = only till ""happy birthday"" song lasts. 1-1.5 minutes"
3.0,July,2021,negative,"Instead of a switch to on and off, they put in a mechanical arrangement, Which trips simply by any small shock like putting it back in the tray. Annoying and need to remove battery if I am travelling or it will keep vibrating while moving.Otherwise brush works fine. Battery life is low."
3.0,December,2021,negative,"It only vibrates when you press the button and as mentioned that top part of brush rotates, it doesn't. It makes a lot of noise but removes plaque, also takes a lot longer than normal brush to brush our teeth."
1.0,December,2023,positive,Unable to start
3.0,November,2022,positive,कीमत थोड़ी ज्यादा है 350 ₹ से ज्यादा कीमत में मंहगा है

1.0,December,2023,negative,Not good
1.0,November,2023,negative,"Faulty item received. Though the packaging was new and intact, the brish did not work. Hence returned. Not buying it anymore."
1.0,October,2023,negative,"This has only one speed for half of the brush, i don't find it ergonomic . I bought this just because it is a amazon product. Expected to be of good quality. Not satisfied."
3.0,December,2022,negative,"Not so good, not too bad."
2.0,April,2023,negative,"It doesn't vibrate any longer. I changed batteries twice, but it just makes noise and doesn't really work any longer.Really upset."
3.0,March,2022,positive,Package delivered today.The product packaging was open. And the battery was installed.The Amazon team would have surely seen the open product..The brush works intermittently.
3.0,November,2022,negative,Battery lasted for 30 days. Expected more.
3.0,November,2022,positive,
1.0,September,2023,negative,"The product started giving problem from the last 6 months and exactly after 1 year it has stopped working.Surprisingly, this product has no warranty and amazon is not aware of it.Don't purchase."
3.0,January,2017,negative,"Product is good and its a repeat purchase. Amazon did a good job since I am a prime member and delivered the product next business day. Seller Cloudtail shipped 2015 December made brush in 2017 January, that's just bad. I am keeping it, since its an unopened box. Also return policy is bad, the power toothbrushes cannot be returned!!!The brush's battery last for good amount of time, you can replace it with Duracell or something and it will last even longer. The brush head can be changed once in three months, its color changes as its life get over. The brushing experience is good, at least I am feeling like its doing a lot better than normal brushes. Kids above 5-6 can use it. I believe you will get soft heads if you want.Last but not the least. MRP is Rs.395, its falsely advertised here as of writing this review as Rs.595."
