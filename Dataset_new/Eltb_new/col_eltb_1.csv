3.0,November,2023,negative,It's made in China but product specifications says Origin is India
1.0,August,2022,negative,"The product just stopped working in 90 days. The other negative thing about the product is that.a. It uses 2 AAA batteries. My previous Oris B used only 1.b. It does not have a 4 x 30-second timer, a standard feature in other brushes.I bought this product with a lot of hope as Colgate is a premium brand. Unfortunately, it did not meet the expectations they had created with their toothpaste and other dental care products.I am a Colgate Shareholder and am happy that electric toothbrush is not their main stay product."
3.0,October,2023,negative,After putting fresh cells not functioning
3.0,August,2023,negative,Circular movement of brush only
2.0,December,2023,negative,Replacement heads are VERY expensive. Will switch to another brand.
2.0,May,2023,negative,"Pros: The vibrations are good in intensity.Cons: Short handle - most people will also be gripping the brush head, quite unlike others. Its not really a con, bt does feel different.  The brush itself has long bristles and is a tight fit for the rear teeth. As a result, it appears to not clean the rear teeth as well as some others.  The brush head fixing arrangement is bad - it's a push fit without a positive lock. Every time you wipe the brush handle - the brush head comes off. Most others use a twist lock that avoids this."
3.0,June,2023,positive,Brush was very good while it worked but got damaged very soon.
3.0,May,2023,neutral,Rechargable electric tooth brush are available in this range.Don't buy this.
3.0,April,2023,negative,Power of this toothbrush is not enough for daily use
3.0,April,2022,positive,"Decent budget friendly product, only cons are the 30 sec timer to turn the brush is not noticeable and it uses battery instead of usb charging, so you need to replace the batteries at a regular interval. Other than these cons, I really liked the product, and I would say it is a good start to my electronic toothbrush journey."
2.0,April,2022,negative,"I don't generally write review of the products but I am so disappointed by this purchase that I don't want the same thing to happen to anyone else.Cons/Dislike - No user manual is included in the product. Wait. It's there but it's printed in Chinese.- Inspite of being an Indian Brand, Except for the ""Colgate"" written on the brush and packing, there is nothing Indian about this product. While receiving and opening the packaging, I literally felt that I am living in China.- It says that there is a 30 second vibration indication but I have never felt it.Pros - They give AAA batteries with the product. And that's it.Don't buy this. Go for Real me or Mi toothbrush. For that matter, go for anything but this one."
3.0,August,2020,negative,"The product is easy to use, but comes with a operating cost a lot higher when compared to the existing toothbrushes in the market. They do come with batteries inside the packaging however, when looked into the initial investment, and the money one needs to spend on the clip on brush refils, it might not make sense. As per the advice, one needs to change the toothbrush after every three months.The most pivotal factor on deciding on a toothbrush however, is the ergonomics anduser experience. The only thing you'll notice right off is your urge to return back to a 'Manual' - 'Muscle-Powered' toothbrush."
3.0,March,2022,positive,Good size and shape. Maybe easy to use. But pls go for recharging ones. You can definitely try the one from caresmith which I have been using for many many months now.
3.0,September,2022,positive,Electric brash vibration make sometime uncomfortable. But it's clean Bater than normal brash
3.0,August,2020,negative,Please be cautious and only use if advised by doctor. it cleans the oral parts well. Strong vibrations. Would be good if had rechargeable batteries. Had sinus problem after using it. Still not sure if the brush caused it or was it something else. Had pain in upper area of face like nose bone and near eye lid. Hence stopped using frequently. I use it twice a week. Cleans as expected.
2.0,July,2020,neutral,"This product worked well for exactly a month. I've been facing an issue since the past 10-12 days. The brush STOPS vibrating automatically after every 2-3 seconds, I have to keep clicking the button everytime I want it to vibrate. If I had to do that I would have used a simple brush which would've cost me 10% of what I paid for this. I've never allowed any water to go in the battery pack or any other joints, just have been wiping the bristles head after use.There seems to be no way to contact anyone regarding this issue. Also noting that there isn't any mention of Warranty or Guarantee here on the product description. Seems like they meant the product to be in a 'Buy it at your own Risk' criteria. Never expected a renowned company such as Colgate to not concentrate about customer relation segments for their electric products."
3.0,May,2022,neutral,Easy to use but not value Of money because it does not help you to clean . It just vibrations.
3.0,July,2022,neutral,"The pack says it comes with a replaceable head, but came with only batteries"
3.0,October,2020,positive,Product itself was good do not expect excellent brushing quality its average but it broke in 3 days i dropped it from 3 feet and it stopped working product could be made little strong as it is intended to use in washroom and it can be slippery
3.0,May,2022,positive,Do not compare with other brandsits cheap and good product
3.0,July,2022,neutral,It's just a normal brush with some vibrations
3.0,July,2021,neutral,"Although I ordered the black charcoal , they sent me a white brush but that's OkThis brush just vibrates and No rotation...I missed this part to check"
3.0,June,2022,positive,Better to use normal brush
3.0,July,2021,positive,Unable to open to reload battery... Used for month it was nice.. But if battary can't be replaced it's not advisable.. But it was nice product...
3.0,July,2020,positive,It's an average product. For a first time attempt it is totally recommended. The batteries also stay for a month if you use twice a day for 6-8min each time.cleaning is satisfactory. But mostly in future never use it again.
2.0,February,2023,positive,Oral b brush is much better
1.0,May,2023,negative,Please don’t buy this product I bought it because I trusted Colgate but I am totally disappointed. This brush is only vibrating is not the brush is not moving at all and also it sounds very annoying that make me headache. So please don’t buy
3.0,March,2021,positive,It is good quality but not that effective. There is no motor to move the bristles. The bristles only vibrate a little to make the paste spread.
3.0,February,2021,positive,"The product looks good, but it is not made in India as stated in the description.Does it amount to any breach as per law?"
1.0,September,2023,positive,
3.0,July,2021,negative,Its vibration may cause other problems for gum and teeth
1.0,July,2023,positive,"Earlier I used to use Braun Automatic toothbrush.It was silent, built quality was superb compared to this."
1.0,March,2023,negative,Poor product. Doesn’t last. I bought mine in Jan and I’m discarding it in March. I’ve changed the battery. Also changed the brush head. Nothing works; it runs for a few seconds and then dies.So I’m forced to discard it. In under 3 months!
1.0,October,2022,negative,"The brush head is too small, it seems like a kids brush. It just vibrates at the bottom not even near the brush head. It’s like using a regular kids toothbrush that vibrates in your hand, instead of your mouth. Don’t but this, use a regular toothbrush. I realised electric toothbrushes are gimmicky after using this product."
2.0,October,2022,negative,The head vibrations are weird and uncomfortable.  The really small head makes brushing a longer task now.
1.0,May,2023,neutral,"Stopped working randomly after 7 months. There is no warranty of any kind as well. Would expect a product of this price and brand to last longer,not an economical toothbrush at all."
1.0,July,2023,positive,Very small brushes and cheap quality dnt buy guys
3.0,June,2020,neutral,"no original  replacement head available... i shall give 5 star if original replacement head is available, u may use 360 head (then why someone eager to buy this product?)"
3.0,March,2021,positive,This is good but not that effective  ..... more battery consumption
2.0,April,2022,neutral,The Brush stopped working in 6 months and there is no warranty or help given by Amazon or Colgate. Choose a different brand.
2.0,March,2020,negative,"It has only nad only vibration function. The bristle area is not flexible, so it does not move at all, just like a tooth brush we have been using for ages. Ibstead, check out pepsodent or other bramd and look outfor those additional functions  that too at a very competitive price. This one is not worth - price wise and utility wise."
3.0,March,2020,negative,"The brush head vibrates but doesn't rotate, so cleaning is not as good compared to the ones in which brush head rotates."
1.0,June,2022,positive,
3.0,February,2020,neutral,The electric brush is not as expected.It's brisstle doesn't vibrate at good speed.Only it's base vibrate.
1.0,June,2022,positive,Initially it felt as a good product but it stopped working within a month. I’m not very fond of writing reviews but I’m doing this for a cause.  I urge you guys to stop wasting your money on this rather buy bamboo brush and contribute to the environment. Thank you
3.0,October,2019,neutral,Not so automatic.I need use it like a normal brush to actually  clean  my teeth.Costly
1.0,March,2023,negative,It’s stopped in 6 months. Why to pay 800 bucks for it. Disappointed by this product. It was not expected from Colgate.
3.0,January,2020,positive,Cap should also be provided. How will one keep it without bruch cap
1.0,May,2023,negative,The toothbrush is so bad it's burst is not moving
3.0,March,2020,negative,Not so great. Manual ultra soft tooth brushes are far better
2.0,August,2021,positive,Value for money not west but this product was removal or brusher are revoval here to there like oral b thn this is good product othernwise jot satisfy sorry
1.0,April,2023,negative,"Despite changing the batteries, the product has completely stopped working in less than 10 months"
1.0,May,2022,negative,"The vibrations on this are too strong and hurt my gums really bad. I have very bad pain on one side of my mouth now, unable to eat even soft foods like bread. Wouldn't recommend for folks with already persistent gum disease definitely"
1.0,June,2022,positive,"The quality of the unit and the built-in timer provided in the brush. It stopped functioning properly in less than a month and if timer does not work, the brush is as good as a child's brush and not at all effective."
3.0,September,2020,positive,Ok. Serves the purpose.
1.0,July,2021,negative,"on two consecutive purchases of this product, i faced the same problem. after a few days of use the timer stops the vibration erratically at short intervals. changing the battery does not help. since it happened on two products, bought on two different occassions, it must be a inherent problem. poor design and low end defective product being dumped in india."
1.0,August,2022,negative,It just doesnt do what an electric toothbrush is supposed to do. The bristles dont rotate at all. Two rubber bristles keep vibrating for no good reason and purpose. Waste of money!
1.0,March,2023,negative,Not reliable brush worked fine for three months and then  it's not working at all now
1.0,April,2022,negative,"Product not same as shown in the description,it is irritating Vibration when we use! Not recommended,waste of money!And most important thing is there is no return policy so our money is wasted! I'm so disappointed!"
3.0,June,2020,neutral,"Nothing great , expected more."
3.0,October,2019,positive,The vibration is too strong
2.0,October,2020,negative,It’s useless as the battery goes of soon and not rechargeableBetter to buy other better and cheaper brands
1.0,November,2022,neutral,The brush only functioned for the first time and later never turned on.
2.0,August,2020,negative,Toothbrush is too intense on the teeth. It is nothing more a vibrating stick. Read reviews.
1.0,July,2022,negative,"Pathetic design stops working after a few seconds, changed the battery still the same, was not expecting it to be this bad."
1.0,February,2021,negative,I have bought two of these and honestly the vibration it provides with the 2 minute timer is useless. The cost is high in terms of function and quality. Better to go for a different brand or at least a different functionality brushing. Vibration doesn’t really help.
1.0,November,2019,negative,"A complete waste of money! I bought it one month ago, and already the 2 minute timer doesn't work. It stops working after a few seconds and you end up brushing your teeth manually! Optimistically bought two spare heads! Guess I'll have to throw the lot into the trash now. Thank you for the experience, Colgate. You've just lost one loyal customer."
1.0,June,2022,positive,"Got two toothbrushes, one works the other DOESN'T and amazon customer care was completely USELESS in helping out with this."

2.0,May,2021,neutral,Not upto the mark

2.0,February,2020,positive,The look is good but the bristles are very soft and not Upto the mark
1.0,January,2020,negative,"It is just a Vibrating Brush, the head and body vibrates giving very little help in Brushing. I haved used Oral B,in which the head rotates and vibrates thus giving a fresh feel in the mouth. Also the batteries needs to be replaced as it does not come with a charger. DONT WASTE money on this product"
1.0,June,2022,negative,I did not like the product.. battery was missing product was not received as expected.
1.0,October,2021,positive,Colgate ProClinical 150 Charcoal Sonic Battery Powered Electric Toothbrush (with Replaceable Brush Head Included). Discription says extra brush heAd included but item arrived without extra brush head.
1.0,April,2022,neutral,"The brush head does not rotate, just vibrates very lightly. Confused as to how does it actually clean. Waste of money."

2.0,December,2020,neutral,Not comfortable
1.0,December,2022,positive,
1.0,February,2022,negative,I feel my money is wasted as it worked for just a month.  Would appreciate a replacement.
1.0,August,2021,negative,Product worked well but died after just 2 months of use. Replaced battery with Duracell but that didn’t help either. Would not recommend.
1.0,February,2021,negative,Stupid useless product. Received a product that potentially looks a used one. The bristles aren't even vibrating -_- Definitely a waste of time and money. A simple brush costing INR 20 would definitely do a better job than this does.
1.0,October,2022,negative,Not cleaning teeh as brush is not good.
2.0,February,2020,positive,Quite OKay...the only problem is battery was not working.
1.0,January,2021,positive,Not suitable for adults. Build quality is good. But not suitable for adults (very small size) so not usable. Tried returning but cannot do so. Suitable as a toy for kids use to familiarize them motorized toothbrush. No actual use.
1.0,January,2020,negative,I thought that this product would be different than other brands but unfortunately this is pathetic. Can not recommend this at all. Brush vibrates but it does not effectively clean. Horrible vibrations and makes pain in teeth if touched. Sound causes pain in ears.
1.0,February,2023,neutral,buying not recommedned
1.0,January,2022,neutral,"The toothbrush only vibrates, doesn't do any else. Don't buy this product if you are looking for a rotating toothbrush"
1.0,August,2020,negative,They are just charging for vibrator insertedI would recommend normal tooth brush insteadPlease its not at all worth youll should instead go for tooth brush which consists of rotator bristlesIg oral b
1.0,July,2022,negative,Purchased in May 2022 now stopped working in July 2022
