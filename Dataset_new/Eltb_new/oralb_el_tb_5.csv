1.0,March,2023,negative,"If it is being shipped to India, the least they can do is to give a charger for 220V.  My charger stopped working in seconds.  Only when I looked at the rating closely it says 100-150V"
2.0,September,2023,negative,Battery lasts for 2 days..Single speed(powerful).not good for daily use..It should be with different modes.I paid around 8000..it doesn't have any box
1.0,August,2021,negative,not good product
,on,27,positive,"Update #2: I know the Pro 1500 isn't on Oral-B's website. When I bought the Pro 1500 nearly a year ago, I asked Oral-B why it's not on their site because I was concerned I had just bought a discontinued product. They assured me that it was in fact a brand new item that they had just released and that they were going to add the Pro 1500 to their site ""soon"".I realize that it's nearly a year later and they still haven't done it even though they are still manufacturing it, but I have been to their site several times per month since then and I can tell you that I'm honestly not surprised it's not on their site yet. I get the impression that anyone could do a better job with their site up-keep than whoever is doing it now. I have even noticed that it's kinda somewhat falling apart. Some elements no longer work and haven't worked for months. Their products are fine, they just need better people to handle and operate their website.Update #1: When I wrote this review, the price was the same for the Pro 1000 and Pro 1500 (including both the black and white Pro 1000s). Today, the price for the Pro 1500 nearly $20 more than it was when I wrote this review, and currently close to $30 more than the Pro 1000.[Original review below]I bought this to replace a very new Vitality. It was a *HUGE* upgrade over the Vitality, but then I saw the Pro 1500 and learned from Oral-B that it's quite superior. The Pro 1000's specs are:- 1 cleaning mode: Daily Clean- 8,800 oscillations per minute and 20,000 pulsations per minute on the Daily Clean mode- A pressure sensor that's supposed to just stop the pulsations when it's triggered- A pro timer that hesitates the motor once every 30 seconds, and 3 times every 2 minutes- A NiMH battery (old technology)- A battery life of 28 minutes (7 days, 2 minutes per day 2 times per day)- A full recharge time of 22 hours- A green charge indicator LED that blinks while charging, but stays off when it's not charging- A red battery level indicator that blinks a few times upon on/off if the battery needs to be charged- The CrossAction brush headThe Pro 1500's specs are:- 2 cleaning modes: Daily Clean and Sensitive- 9,900 oscillations per minute and 45,000 pulsations per minute on the Daily Clean mode (these speeds are faster than any I've seen so far in the specs of any of Oral-B's electric toothbrushes, including the Genius 8000 - they all seem to top out at 8,800 oscillations per minute and 40,000 pulsations per minute)- 7,400 oscillations per minute and 33,000 pulsations per minute on the Sensitive mode- A pressure sensor using a red LED that turns on when the pressure sensor is triggered- A pro timer that hesitates the motor once every 30 seconds, and 3 times every 2 minutes- A Lithium Ion battery- A battery life of 56 minutes (14 days, 2 minutes per day 2 times per day)- A full recharge time of 12 hours- A green charge indicator LED that blinks while charging, but stays off when it's not charging- A red battery level indicator that blinks a few times upon on/off if the battery needs to be charged.- The CrossAction brush headThe Vitality is extremely basic:- 1 cleaning mode: Daily Clean- 7,600 oscillations per minute.- A timer that hesitates the motor 3 times every 2 minutes- A NiMH battery- A battery life of 20 minutes (5 days, 2 minutes per day 2 times per day)- A full recharge time of 19 hours- No charge indicators or battery life indicators- Mine came with the Sensitive Gum Care brush headIn comparison, the Vitality seems like a cheap generic electric toothbrush. Don't consider buying it.When I upgraded to the Pro 1000, it was amazing. I wanted to burst at the seams and write an extremely rave review, but then I learned about *and ordered* the Oral-B Pro 1500. After using it, I can tell you that the Pro 1500 is *FAR* better than the Pro 1000. I honestly feel the Pro 1000 should be discontinued and no one should ever buy it. I mean really, the Pro 1500 is only $10 more right now and it destroys the Pro 1000.I would have given the Pro 1000 4 stars instead of just 3 if it had a Lithium Ion battery. They charge faster and last longer without charging.So yeah, I am not sure I would recommend the Pro 1000 if you can get the Pro 1500. The Pro 1500 is a much wiser purchase. I'm *extremely* happy with mine. It blows the Pro 1000 out of the water."
,on,22,positive,"I had a Philips Sonicare for many years, that recently died. I bought this toothbrush primarily for the oscillating motion, since that's what dentists use (I literally had the thought as a child, ""why don't our toothbrushes look like the dentist's?""). After using this Oral-B for a few days, I'm glad I bought it, but I also hate it.I hate that it *stutters* when it's time to switch tooth quadrants, vs the Sonicare that makes a gentle change in pitch. I hate that it doesn't stop after going through four quadrants, that it just stutters harder, and you have to turn it off manually (unlike the Sonicare). I hate that the noise is louder and harsher than the Sonicare. I hate that there is only one button, so you will always have to press it at least four times total during brushing in order to turn it off. I hate that I can't tell the difference between the brushing modes at all (the pitch seems to go *down* slightly when cycling, so is the first mode the strongest? I can't tell. Only thing I can tell is that the third setting seems to vary in velocity, which, why?). I REALLY hate that the instructions refer to it as type 3757, and in every distinct section of the instructions it never refers to that type number, but it does consistently refer to three *other* type numbers, leaving me totally in the dark on this toothbrush's functionality (particularly what the different brushing modes are, if they are different). I hate that it claims, on this very Amazon page, that there is a pressure sensor, but as hard as I press absolutely nothing changes (unlike the Sonicare); AND the instructions specifically say that the pressure sensor is only for type 3791. I also hate that the battery life is allegedly significantly worse than the Sonicare (supposedly one week only for the Oral-B, and I used to get a month on one charge brushing twice a day with the Sonicare).All that being said, it is more aggressive, and the oscillating motion does feel more thorough. In short, my teeth definitely feel cleaner after brushing with this vs the Sonicare. That plus the fact that brushheads are cheaper means I will stick with this even though I hate it. I'd advise others to consider a more expensive model if they address any of these myriad annoyances I've found."
,on,3,negative,"I have used a different brand for years, but my dentist suggested I try an Oral B because it does as good a job and the brush heads (and in this case, also, the unit itself) are less expensive. He noted that the round brush head is easier to get into the molars all the way in the back. He especially recommended an Oral B because it is supposed to stop if you apply too much pressure.Well, it turns out I do like the small brush head a lot, and I don't  mind the noisiness of the Oral B. (My other brand emitted a tone--I think it was the B below middle C--that I enjoyed harmonizing with while I brushed, but never mind that!)  But I also have some disappointments:1) Maybe I got a bad unit, but I am astonished by how often it needs recharging--every few days, it seems. (I may call Oral-B tomorrow to ask about this.) Other reviews, I think, claimed that it held its charge for a long time.2) The brush does not stop pulsing if I apply too much pressure, as it is supposed to do. I have tried to make it stop, just to verify.3) The integrated button on the handle is not as responsive to the touch as I would like.  It requires more effort to shut it off than it should.4) I have no idea how to access the ""3 EASY-TO-USE CLEANING MODES."" Usually these things strike me as so much baloney, so that's not a make-or-break for me.(Also: I wish it came with a case.)It is not an expensive  model, and I don't need all the bells and whistles (bluetooth??!!). I am mostly irritated by the need to recharge it often."
,on,18,negative,"I’ve used Oral-b toothbrushes for quite a while and I have always liked them. After my last one died (it had lasted almost ten years) I was looking for something new but didn’t want to pay a lot. I settled on this one after looking at the pros and cons of the different models. It is much like the other models I have had with a couple of exceptions. First it doesn’t beep at each 30-second mark. Instead it pulses. Even after using it for six months I’m always thinking I’ve missed the pulse. The second issue is a bigger one. The toothbrush is supposed to have a pressure sensor that stops the brush if you press to hard against your teeth. I’ve tried and I can’t seem to get that to work.Oh, and I really like the color of the toothbrush. The black stands out nicely. However it seems to be impossible to find black replacement brushes so as soon as you need to change the head you move into the two-tone-toothbrush mode.So mixed review from ne on this one. Oral-b is a great toothbrush but I might have been better off spending a little more on a better model."
,on,5,positive,"The feature ratings are- Deep Cleaning: 5- Timer Function: 3- Bluetooth connectivity: 1I'll address those in turn, then address the title.Deep Cleaning: jeez is this thing effective. You have two different intensities, depending on how hard you press the brush against your teeth. I use it in tandem with a rigorous flossing routine and a hard bristle brush for large debris removal. It offers a genuinely clean feeling (like I just got out of the hygienist's chair) most of the time, with me just paying mind to the timer.Timer Function: you'll get a hard-to-miss vibration every 30 seconds. One ""play"" of this sequence for every quadrant of your mouth to guide your cleaning, with the fourth being more pronounced, to tell you ""you're done"" (with the dentist recommended 2-minutes of brushing). It's solid but has significant shortcomings.1. If you stop brushing before you finish the cycle-of-4 (or if you brush for longer), the brush isn't smart enough to know that. There doesn't seem to be an internal ""smart reset"" mechanism, and there is no means of manually triggering such except to let the brush run and to turn it off as soon as you hear/feel the 4th-cycle pattern.2. There are occasions when the brush seems to be smart enough to detect *something* about restart the *count* to 4, but it doesn't reset the 30-sec timer. That's just strange.So why 3 stars? Because I've bought cheaper tooth brushes that are more consistent (e.g. just turning off the motor after the cycle-of-4) with their timers' behavior. This one does more, but inconsistently, and was more expensive. 3 star value for 3 star functionality.Bluetooth: functionality doesn't exist. No idea what they're talking about.The Title: why do I ""hate"" it? Water capture. Water, and tooth-pasty saliva, get caught in the weirdest places in this brush, such that I can rarely complete a brushing without much of it trickling down my hand, wrist, and arm. Might I also mention that I have to store the brush head on a towel, so the trapped water will flow out in a managed space, rather than caking (e.g.) the brush with tooth-pasty water spots? The only mitigation I've found is a near-constant inhalation as means of suctioning the moisture to stay in my mouth. This is the first electric toothbrush with which I've had this problem. The dripping effect varies from brush head to brush head (which need to be swapped rather often, especially if you are undergoing orthodontia) which suggests a manufacturing quality-control issue.I would not buy it again, knowing this is what I was getting into. I wish it wasn't the case, because you can tell they tried to make something quality, but effort and execution are different things.If someone could prove to me that it's just faulty hardware or my poor technique, I would gladly improve the rating."
,on,9,negative,"It’s hard to adjust the various settings. Lots of noises and vibrations make brushing a bad experience. It jerks to tell the user to change quadrant. The on off button is supposed to control the various brushing actions but really don’t notice any difference from one setting to the other.  It seems like it never turns off unless you turn it off. How anyone is able to time brushing from quadrant to another beats me. It seems to clean your teeth but it’s not a pleasant experience. I guess like anything else it takes time to get used to this thing and understand its limited functions. For a device that has been around for many years I am not impressed with this poorly engineered electric toothbrush.  I also have a Sonicare electric toothbrush and it’s far more sophisticated and user friendly. Buy a waterpik to get between your teeth, floss daily, use a good mouthwash, and use good old fashioned tooth brush."
,on,8,positive,I bought this one as a travel electric toothbrush.  It works ok but does not have the deep cleaning that my Phillips electric toothbrush does.  When I press hard on the Oral B it stops the brush.  I also do not care for the press the on off button three times to turn it off.  The brush goes from fast to slow then off.  All in all it was much cheaper than the Phillips and is perfect for travel.  If it were my one and only I would return.
,on,28,positive,"Hello! I loved this toothbrush, it did an amazing job and I always felt so clean after each use.  Until I started to notice it wouldn’t turn on the first time pressing the bottom and one day it completely stopped working. I’ve been told that they can last 5+ years but I only used mine for about 2 years before it completed stopped turning on. Is there a way I can receive a refund or receive a new one? Please and thank you!"
,on,11,negative,It's a nicely looking toothbrush with polished handle.  Which makes it very slippery and difficult to use when it naturally becomes wet.  It supposed to have some additional features like timer etc. which don't work properly. If you need a basic model - go for Oral-B Pro 500.  If you need more advanced features - go for higher end model.  Either way there is no reason to buy this one.
,on,12,negative,Compared to my last electric toothbrush this thing is loud and the vibrations are really rough. Seems to do the job though. Also there is a plug in stand for it that’s a pain. My last one didn’t have a stand and you could charge it off a little usb cord. Much more convenient. Expected more from Oral B.
,on,16,positive,Not high quality but it gets the job done. Not sure how long it will last as I’ve only had it about a month. Not good to compare to a high dollar toothbrush but you only have to hold it so it’s good enough. Will  spend more money on the next one I get.
,on,9,positive,"For the money it is good. The battery life is poor. You need to keep this on the charger or in 12 hours battery would be weak. Also, very difficult to shut off. I purchased several months ago but now looking for one that is higher quality."
,on,7,positive,"It’s a good product, definitely cleaned my teeth better than a regular non-electric toothbrush. However, I bought a black toothbrush and got sent a blue one instead, which is troublesome since my roommate has the exact same one. It’s annoying but I’m too lazy to return anyway…"
,on,25,positive,"Love the toothbrush but it has a very bright and large green blinking light when charging, which lights up the bathroom and adjacent bedroom at night. You’ll need to close the door to the bathroom or use an eye mask."
,on,21,negative,"I ordered this after using a spinbrush with rechargeable AA batteries for several years, and then using some cheapo sonic toothbrush for a while. I thought it would be great in comparison due to Oral B being an actual brand and it being fairly expensive.Wow was I wrong. Reasons I hate this thing and am getting rid of it:1. I don't know if it's my mouth shape, brushing technique, or what, but this thing always tends to drip along the back and I always end up with a gross trickle of toothpaste-spit on my hand and on the handle.2. The controls are dumb. It has 3 different speeds. Even the cheap generic sonic brush I had would remember your last speed and just default to that. I'd click to turn it on, click to turn it off. You could change speed by double clicking. Great! But not this POS. You have to cycle through all the speeds every time. You can at least turn it off by holding down the button for a couple of seconds, but COME ON. WHY? Really dumb controls.3. The battery only lasts less than 2 weeks, brushing 2x per day. That seems really short? My previous 2 brushes were weeks, maybe months, between recharging. Minor inconvenience, but still annoying that after a week the thing is already slowing down. I could have left it on a charger all the time but I like my vanity to be tidier than that, and don't think I should have to have a cable management system for a gd toothbrush.Anyway, I left it 2 stars because it's a working electric toothbrush, but I'm tempted to give it a 1. Will not be buying replacement heads, or any other oral b toothbrush ever again."
,on,7,negative,"The plastic rib on the power unit (handle) that is supposed to hold the brush head body steady wears quickly.  When this happens, the bristles do not rotate (oscillate) as they should, even though the motor runs properly.  Instead, the brush head body itself turns, while the bristles move only a little, or not at all.  I have tried inserting a metal shim in the slot between the plastic rib and the ""keyway"" in the brush head, but this gives at best a weak, temporary improvement.  Changing out the brush head for a brand new one does nothing to improve the action."
,on,28,negative,"I'd read some comments about how loud this toothbrush is, but, I figured, how loud can it be? The answer is TOO LOUD! I've had probably 10 different electric toothbrushes in the last 20 years, and this is easily the loudest. It's obnoxious!Also, the charge lasts only about a week, and that's too short a time for my use. If you are able to keep it on the charger all the time, that probably doesn't matter.I do like the round head. That shape makes more sense to me than others, which is why I switched.When I buy my next toothbrush, which will be soon, I'll get another Oral B, but it'll be one with a much lower decibel rating."
,on,27,positive,The brush cleansing part works very well however the on/off switch never works correctly. I am always pressing multiple areas to hit the right spot to turn on AND off.
,on,4,negative,After a month the battery seems losing  Harte capability. I have to charge twice a week instead  once. The head brush bristles starting opening sooner than expected.
,on,7,positive,Toothbrush is ok…. Was hoping for a little more power. It stalls out if too much pressure applied… might be a safety feature….
,on,15,negative,"I previously had a sonicare electric toothbrush, so maybe I’m biased but this Oral B isn’t my favorite. I went with it because I thought I should try something new (and my Sonicare died after 3-4 years). It gets the job done; my teeth are probably clean. However, it’s loud, the toothbrush head is too big for my mouth so I have to keep my mouth open and toothpaste is falling out everywhere (it is hilarious to watch tho), and it feels cheaper overall. I’m told that there are “compact” brush heads, but I’ve been looking and I can’t find that description anywhere; however that could be on me. Also I think there is a timer, and it buzzes every 30 seconds. It doesn’t turn off after 2 minutes, so I’m a little confused by that feature. I’m a bit picky for sure, but I wouldn’t recommend this. :/"
,on,18,positive,"It cleans my teeth great, and for that I love it! But it is so so loud!!"
,on,24,negative,"This toothbrush gets my teeth clean after every time I use it. I can tell it massages my gums when I am brushing my teeth. I can't really tell when it lets me know that I am brushing too hard on my teeth, maybe when it vibrates. I wish it would turn off and let me know that 2 minutes is up after I had brushed my teeth. I find it very annoying that I have to press the off button 3 times in order to turn off the toothbrush. lastly, I don't like how I have to keep on charging it in several days, now that can be very annoying, but overall, a nice toothbrush to have."
,on,27,negative,This is not a toothbrush that you can use if others are sleeping. It's noisy.
,on,1,positive,"Love this and the color, however I have to charge it every 2 days."
,on,5,negative,"This was my first electric toothbrush and I definitely feel like it cleans my teeth better than I do manually. However, the battery life on this isn’t very long compared to similar products and you may have to spend a lot more time brushing than manually. It’s also extremely loud and I mean very very loud!!! The noice is the main part the company needs to improve on. Otherwise this toothbrush is a decent buy."
,on,30,negative,"The brushing is just fine, and I guess that's the important thing, but the recessed on/off button is difficult to locate by feel, even more difficult to turn on, and more difficult still to turn off. I have to use my thumbnail to exert enough force even after I find the thing. My old Spinbrush had two raised buttons, a large one for on, a smaller one for off. Very easy to find and operate. Perhaps my old arthritic thumb is the problem, but I bet there are a lot of folks with the same issue. I find it annoying enough that I may have to pass it on to another family member and go back to an easier to use model."
,on,18,negative,Variable speed is poor.
,on,4,positive,I bought this based on all the positive reviews. I was used to a Phillips and thought I would give it a try. I like it far less than the Phillips. Its a very aggressive and loud toothbrush. In fairness it seems like it cleans really well but I do not enjoy brushing with it at all. My entire head shakes when I use it.
,on,12,negative,"I enjoyed the product from may 2019 to November 2023. Yesterday the battery stopped charging. Green light flashed quickly and battery doesn't fill up so the toothbrush no longer works. The warranty period is for 2 years only, so that's that. That's what I will expect from my next toothbrush. Not a long-term investment but it's 40 bucks so still probably cheaper than what I would have spent on manual toothbrushes over the course of 5 years. Disappointed I can't do anything to fix it. Will find a place to hopefully recycle the parts."
,on,19,positive,"It is small and lightweight, but I am regretting buying it. My hands are somewhat stiff from arthritis and when it gets wet, it slips from my hand. Anyone with  normal function of the hands should be very happy with this. The price is good."
,on,8,negative,"This toothbrush didn't work as well as expected. Hard to turn on and off, loud and runs slower then a $10 grocery store battery operated brush. The shipping box was battered as well as box the toothbrush came in...would not recommend. It was a bought as a gift😔"
,on,12,neutral,"En la descripción dice q tiene temporizador y sensor para evitar cepillado duro, pero no hace nada de eso. A parte del color no veo diferencia con un cepillo electrónico sencillo"
,on,21,negative,"I thought I was buying a toothbrush with a timer on it - apparently not or it doesn't work.The toothbrush is excessively noisy - like a car without a muffler.However, it does do a good job of cleaning"
,on,24,negative,Pressure indicator is not visual and to be honest is imperceptible. I wish I did not buy it as pressure indicator of my brushing was the main reason I bough this.
,on,10,negative,Works well but it’s so loud! I had a different electric toothbrush prior to this one and it was significantly quieter than this one.
,on,20,negative,"To turn off this toothbrush I have to push the off button 3 times. Now that may have something to do with the mode you're in at the time...but as soon as I push button to come on, it's always in the same fast, uncomfortable mode (bangs my teeth around no matter how lightly I hold it against surface of teeth) AND as others have noted, it IS loud.  -- Am returning"
,on,18,negative,The handle has no anti slip material - so I’m constantly dropping the toothbrush - not sure why they made it like this - not user friendly!
,on,26,negative,I have arthritis in my hand and it is hard to turn off. I turn it off before taking it out of my mouth or it splatters everywhere. My previous electric toothbrush was easier to use. The brush head is also bigger than I am used to.
,on,29,negative,Liked the item. Had a problem. Went to website looking for help. The whole website is about sales of oral b products. Used phone number on website and got more sales talk. No help with the problem.
,on,11,positive,"I don’t need or want all the bells and whistles (or high price) of the higher end Oral-B rechargeable electric toothbrushes found at Costco and online. This brush effectively gets the job done and came at a good price (under $40).My only issue is the power button. A simple press will turn on the brush, but I need to press firmly for two seconds to turn it off."
,on,13,negative,"Not much to like for me. This toothbrush is very loud and rough. And my teeth don't feel as clean as they did with my old cheap sonic one. The on/off switch is awkward to use (the button isn't easy to push and you need to push it 4 times to turn it off). It doesn't hold a charge very long (yes, we charged it for 24 hours before using). I don't like the charging stand- I prefer a separate small charger that plugs into the bottom (and only needs charged every 2 weeks). The final straw is it only came with one head, and the 3-head package at the grocery store was $30 which my husband bought before we realized how much we hated the toothbrush. The only potential upside is that some reviewers say this one lasts for years (not helpful if you don't like it) and the sonic ones seem to die after a year and a half."
,on,5,negative,This product lasted only two years and they suddenly stopped charging so is useless now.  Looks like it was just over a month outside the dates for the product support window.
,on,5,negative,"I've had many oral B toothbrushes. This is a basic model that functions very well, but the signature quality feel and appearance is missing. This just looks and feels cheap."
,on,5,negative,The button is hard to push in to turn on
,August,2023,negative,"I finally decided to try out an electric toothbrush, hummed and hawed before figuring I should go with the cheap version (just in case I hated it!)The cheap version (or older model if you want to be specific) makes brushing those hard to reach spots so much easier. I am still adjusting to using less pressure and get warning buzzes on the daily to relaxI find brushing my teeth 2x daily sees this thing going on the charger every 4 or so days, basically twice a week. I feel like it takes a long time to charge too, if I plug it in in the morning it only finishes charging around supper time. If you’re homebody it’s merely a nuisance but if you go somewhere do not forget that charging stand!I saw some other reviews before purchasing that describe it as pretty noisy, to be clear it vibrates so loudly that I am pretty sure my neighbours think I am busy with other activities…Overall I like it, it does the job, but I do wish I had gotten a new model to test out with a longer battery lifeSo if you’re debating between this and a new(er) model, spend the extra bit of money and go newer!"
,on,25,negative,I feel like this bad boy is constantly trying to slip out of my hand due to it's cylindrical shape. I wish it was built with a better material or more ergonomic shape to make it easier to hold onto.
,on,5,positive,battery life only one week.
,on,15,negative,This brush works well once on but I have a very hard time turning it on and off. It is like the power switch is indented. I wish I had returned it as it drives me crazy that it is so difficult to turn off in the middle of brushing (or when done).
,January,2024,negative,"I had the Oral-B Pro 3000 for 3 years before it broke (dropped it) and it was the perfect Oral-B.Decided to purchase this model since it was on sale. I absolute hate the feel of it because of the material. It has a shiny coating on the plastic all around, making it a little bit slippery when brushing your teeth since you mostly are in a wet environment (the 3000 model has a rubbery silicone outer layer and the grip was outstanding).Also, the ''On'' button is inward (concave) and doesn't really click when pressing it, so you have to press a little bit harder than usual to have a response (the 3000 ''On'' button was outward (convexe) and it clicked, making it way way more easy to turn it off when needed).If you are planning to use it everyday, get the 3000 model (I also use a Sonicare, so I will probably keep this model until the 3000 model is on sale). The only good thing is that it uses the Oral-B rotation technology, so it will still clean your teeth thoroughly !"
,on,30,positive,"It’s a nice model, but the brush is definitely not soft, and a bit on the large size. Brushing is noisy."
,November,2023,neutral,"Owned for 8 months.Generic electric toothbrush, no way to disable the 30 second notifier to switch quadrants while brushing which can be annoying.Battery is OK, but a full charge takes way too long.The base that holds brush head on the body is starting to come off, product was well taken care of, sort of a shame to see but maybe just unlucky with mine."
,June,2023,neutral,"Mine sounds like a remote control airplane when it starts up. I am pretty sure my neighbours can hear it when I turn it on (awkwarrrrrd, I am brushing my teeth, yall. I promise! lmao). Also think it's important to note, it's just a high-powered vibrating brush, it's not actually spinning from what I can tell - I didn't read the description that well so for people who skip descriptions and go for reviews, you're not buying what you think you're buying. I see why it was so cheap now. That being said, it looks nice, and it does still offer a deeper clean than a standard toothbrush. I also don't know what any of the settings or lights or anything are doing, because I didn't read the instructions.  I'm saying that because it's not a plug-and-play thing. You'll need to read the instructions to know how to use that toothbrush and that's more effort than I am looking to put into my toothbrush. Still, if you're on a budget and need a deeper clean - this is your sign to buy!"
,on,18,negative,"Have had Oral B electric toothbrushes for forever.  They are terrific and my dentist is consistently thrilled with my check-ups.  That being said, my toothbrushes died recently.  They were 8 years old.  Purchased 2 new ones and find the ""on/off button"" is amazingly difficult to engage.  WTH?  Both my husband and I are having the same problem so it isn't operator error.  The on buttons are terribly unresponsive.  You have to really push your nail directly into the center of the button for to turn on (or off) and that usually takes several tries.  Will need to see if I can return.  I stupidly threw the boxes out assuming Oral B would provide a superior product.  Buyer beware!"
,on,16,positive,"The brush works great, even though it's a little louder than the my old Sonicare.I took stars off because, afte revery use, you need to remove the brush head to rinse the toothpaste out of the connection ring, and inside the head itself. For some reason, there is a hole in the neck of the brush, right under the bristles, where that will fill and get moldy & crusty if not rinsed out after every use."
,on,13,negative,"Good for the price, but there are sacrifices. Though I'm sure it's getting my teeth clean, it seems as loud as a tractor and is hard to turn off using just one hand."
,on,7,positive,Wish this had a timer on it
,on,25,negative,Was broken and felt cheap out of the box
,on,1,positive,It was just ok
,February,2024,negative,My elderly mother has problems turning it on and off. Very cheap power button mechanism.
,on,8,negative,"I’ve used the original Braun rechargeable toothbrush for years. I purchased this model because I felt I should buy a new one.Although I like the way my teeth feel after brushing,I was disappointed that the features advertised“ The pressure sensor stops the pulsation movement if you brush too hard and the in handle timer helps you brush for a dentist recommended 2 minutes3 modes (Daily Clean, Whiten, and Sensitive) to break up and sweep away plaque” do not apply to this model. Also it’s so difficult to shutoff. I do need two hands to shut it off.I’m not sure how the battery charge will be since I only have it a short time.I hope this information helps ."
,December,2023,positive,Decent but next time will spend the money for better quality and feel.
,on,25,negative,"After using a Sonicare for years, I decided to see what was regarded as the best out there currently as a replacement.  The Oral-B was rated #1 on several of the sites I looked at so I went for it.  The biggest take away is the battery life is terrible.  Also, the charging time is terrible.  With the Sonicare, I didn't keep the toothbrush on the base unless it needed a charge.  Even after 10+ years with the same unit, I'd have to charge it maybe twice a month.  With this Oral-B, it starts dragging after 5 days max.  I stick it on the charger before going to bed and find it's not fully charged in the morning.  When it is fully charged, it works fine.  I wouldn't say there's any noticeable step-up from the Sonicare with it.  But with the battery life/charging situation, I'll likely be replacing it with something else soon."
,on,28,negative,"""I'm not sure if I received a defective product, but the battery life of this toothbrush is disappointing, especially given its price. I bought it as a replacement for another electric brush that no longer offers replacement heads. Despite charging it overnight, I find that it only lasts a single day before needing to be recharged, even though I only brush twice a day. It's puzzling because I'm not leaving it on all day or using it continuously. Additionally, it's quite noisy and feels somewhat outdated. In my opinion, there are better and more affordable options available."""
,on,27,neutral,Circular brush cleans well but it's bulky particularly in back of the mouth. I preferred the fit of my previous electric brush with smaller rectangular head.
,on,3,negative,I love the oral B but I have to charge it every couple of days .  It's very inconvenient
,on,27,negative,"Since toothbrush has no real grip, it gets hard to hold onto in use. Slippery. Old version was matte and grippier."
,on,16,negative,The on/off switch is indented and not a button above surface. I have arthritis and this makes it very difficult to operate. Other than that I no other complaints.
,on,8,positive,"Toothbrush was amazing for about 30 days.  Then all of a sudden, it stopped working.  Is there any way to get an exchange?  $50 is a lot to spend for a toothbrush! Edit:  The return window had just closed about a week earlier, but I was able to contact Amazon Customer Service and I asked them to allow the return, and they did.  I do love the toothbrush.  It does a great job."
,on,24,negative,"As others have said, the actual toothbrush is great, but the on off button is stupid and hard to push"
,October,2023,negative,"Useless battery life. After a night recharge, you still cannot use it for more than 5 times (2 days) before it drops dead. Such battery life is very inconvenient compared to other brands such as Philips which I had for 4 years."
,July,2023,negative,"I purchased this brush after having a Sonicare brush for several years.  I wanted to try the round brush head and I like the brush head a lot - for me, it is better for cleaning back teeth and seems to do a very good job.  However, the bush is very noisy - to the point of being irratating first thing in the morning.  I also find the stem of the brush to be quite large and therefore more uncomfortable in my mouth and also messier.  Although I will keep this brush for travel or a spare, I will buy another for everyday use - probably going back to Sonicare as they are far less noisy.  Sorry, Oral B - if you can make them quieter and with a thinner stem, then this would be the perfect brush"
,October,2023,positive,Not thrilled with the tooth brush - replaced my old one which I loved and was the same brand . On /off button seems to stick on this one making it harder to turn on and off  😞
,November,2023,positive,I like the toothbrush but it stalls occasionally during use.It is also a bit noisier than I expected.It does good job on cleaning teeth.
,on,10,negative,"This Oral B Pro 1000 toothbrush is not as well engineered as the previous version.  The handle is very slippery, especially when wet.  I have dropped the toothbrush twice already.  The ON/OFF switch is indented rather than raised, which makes it very difficult to find and turn off while using the toothbrush.  The three brushing modes are more annoying than helpful, since you generally have to cycle through them to turn off the brush.  You can press and hold the ON/OFF switch to turn off the brush, but it is awkward to do so.  If you can get past the defects, the toothbrush cleans well."
,November,2023,negative,"I've been using an Oral B electric toothbrush for years and it was time to get a new one. The only difference from the old one, is that this one is ""wrapped"" and is very difficult to turn off."
,June,2023,neutral,"I've had OralB electric toothbrushes for a few decades now and like them. I replaced my previous version because it was looking old - it was still working ok though.This new one works fine, but when I asked P&G about the 'mode' feature not seeming to work, they told me that 3791 toothbrush comes with 1 mode or 3 depending on when it was produced. It seems mine was an older version made prior to July of 2022.(If I read the date code correctly, the brush sent to me was made September 2021)Still, it works fine as did my previous ones. Recommended.I recommend that the seller should indicate that a buyer might get an older version that does not have all the features advertised."
,on,6,negative,"I had many Oral-B electric toothbrushes before, and they were excellent, but this one has a convex on/off button instead of convex, i.e. it is buried down and you have to use nails or press really hard and decisive to turn it on or off. It is probably a problem with big hands and people with small fingers do not have this problem."
,on,2,negative,"This is… fine. I previously had a Quip toothbrush, but they seemed to break after a year of use. So I wanted to jump off the Quip train and onto something else. The Oral B 1000 definitely cleans your teeth. But… it’s unusually loud, the spin and vibration are not terribly smooth, and it is difficult to turn off.  Its competitor at Phillips vibrates but does not rotate. It also has the smooth vibration and is easy to turn off. Idk how the pricier Oral B options compare. I’m still considering whether I want to return this for the Phillips."
,December,2020,positive,"quick-n-dirty:  great for use with more aggressive toothpastes that you'd only use once a day or 2-3 times a week, but too loud for twice-a-day use.  sonicare is nicer.detailed: by now, i have this Oral B 1000, an older Vitality, a Sonicare 4100, and an older Sonicare 2 Series.  the 4100 is my favourite since it's quiter, smoother, and i get a better feel of where the brush head is against my teeth.  this 1000 is certainly powerful, though, and if i use it twice-a-day my gums are unhappy so i use this one only for occasional whitening with peroxide toothpastes.  oddly enough, i have an Oral B Vitality from 4-5 years ago that's quieter, smoother, though clearly slower and less powerful - but has amazing battery life (just a hair over 70 minutes!!!)the charger is great and small, as is the toothbrush, so i guess for traveling it's fine - but why not just take a manual one!?!?  seriously, for travel, go manual.the timer works well, though i tend to brush for longer, like 4min.  i guess that's my own ""pace"", which is fine because i can still make use of the 30sec pacer to do top-left-outside, top-left-inside, bottom-left-outside, etc.  or i can spend the full 2min on just whitening the most visible teeth.overall even if clinically the Oral B is better than the Sonicare, i prefer the feel of the Sonicare, so 3 stars for you.  the price is fine, replacement brush heads (generic) are fine, but it's just too loud and racket-y considering the alternatives from Philips.  for the same approximate money, i DEFINITELY prefer the Sonicare 4100."
,on,3,negative,"I have used Sonicare for years and loved them! But I decided to try another brand after the rechargeable battery died within two years and also to try something new. So I got this one and I don’t like it at all! I thought it was a matter of getting used to something new, but it isn’t. I don’t like the head brush, it is big, yet it does not cover my whole tooth like the show in the commercial: apply it on top of your tooth and it cleans all around it, for me? Not the case, so I have to maneuver around my teeth with would not be a problem if the brush head wasn’t so big. But my biggest shock is how LOUD this is! To compare it to the Sonicare, the Oral B is like using a a blow drier vs a flat iron to do your hair!I wish I could return it but I got it about five days ago and have been using it- I was really hoping it was a matter of getting used to it. I’ll definitely go back to my prior model."
,June,2023,positive,"It’s ok, nothing special about it that I can say is worth the price compared to the regular base model. I’ve used oral b electric toothbrushes for almost 10 years now, usually the “base model” blue one with different types of heads… and this one, I can’t really tell the difference. I bought it because I thought it has a sensor to detect if you are putting too much pressure at the gums. It doesn’t have that. But I had it already so I kept it, I needed a new one anyway. In general I find the chargers don’t last. I got this last year March and now the charger is dead so I have to replace. Overall… it’s ok, just as good as the cheaper base model blue and white one."
,on,28,negative,"So I originally gave it a one star because it wasn't working . Although it deserves a one star still I cannot give it a one star. After brutally smashing the toothbrush against my bathroom counter, it started working perfectly fine. My guess is that a wire was not fitted correctly to a terminal or something of this nature. Although it's working now, still very frustrating. The lack of quality control is very common with Black Friday deals. How's the old saying goes? You get what you pay for. Most of the time. There are some good deals to be had, but it's typically not found with electronics though there are exceptions. The days of great deals on Black Friday seem to be over. The heyday of Black Friday deals where everybody flooded into the store and got amazing. Prices just isn't the same anymore.  Dead on arrival. I'm going to get another one but yeah absolutely did not work I tried everything I could think of. I usually give great reviews but once in awhile I have to give a bad review. Maybe I should get a sonicare honestly?"
,December,2023,negative,lt is actually vwery noisy compared to my old one
,on,3,negative,"This was recommended to me, but I ended up going back to Sonicare. The main reason is that the Oral-B brushhead is just too big for my mouth. I even tried the pediatric version, but it didn't help. My mouth just does not open wide enough for this. Also, it is heavier than Sonicare and very loud. Wish it had a gentler setting, too, like Sonicare. But my main problem is the size of the brushhead. So I gave it away and got a new Sonicare instead. Much happier now."
,on,24,negative,"It has an extremely annoying feature of jolt-vibrating every 30 seconds that you can't turn off. It takes 3 button presses to turn it off. It slips out of your hand when you're using it. I couldn't stand using it after a couple days. I had to buy the old Vitality version with the rubber grip, turns off after one button press, and doesn't do a 30 second reminder, only a 2 minute one. I didn't give it 1 star because it's still a toothbrush that does work as advertised."
,on,2,negative,"I've been using Oral B Vitality electric toothbrushes for many years.  They usually lasted from 2 to 3 years until the plastic stem which holds the brush wore down where it wouldn't hold the brush in place.  The battery and motor still functioned like new.I recently bought this Crossaction as a replacement.  It has a higher speed motor and works just fine.  However, it does not have the textured surface like the Vitality.  About half way through brushing, my hand gets covered in wet toothpaste draining from my mouth and it is impossible to hold onto the toothbrush any longer.  It just slides out of my hand.  I have to stop and wash the toothpaste off of the surface and then go back to brushing.  Very annoying.I need to find some type of non-slip stick on material to apply to the handle of the toothbrush."
,December,2023,positive,
,on,22,positive,"I bought one in black, and I wanted one mode: power on, power off, easy to do before removing from the mouth. That's what I got, it's great.Bought the exact same one in blue for my 78-year-old-mother, for the same reason - power on, power off, easy to manage for someone with weak hands.The blue one came with three modes. You have to press the button three times to turn it off. Exact same model number on the bottom, type 3791.So the one I got for the person who *really* needs it to be simple...isn't.Seriously? Come on."
,on,18,negative,"Not impressed,  The wire review said this was a very good brush even though it is less money.  I have difficulties with it charging.  The switch is very difficult as I have minor arthritis in my hand.  I switched from a $90 Sonicare and that was much easier to use.  I switched because the Sonicare was leaving some rather large food particles.  The different brushing mechanism on this does a better job but if it does not work because of charging why bother with it."
,on,6,positive,"This toothbrush did not function as well as I thought it would. After reading all the positive reviews, I decided that the Oral B Pro 1000 was right for me. I thought it should have cleaned more deeply and efficiently than what I experienced. After a month or more of use, I realized that I was beginning to accumulate plaque on my teeth. I have switched back to my handheld brush which is doing a sufficient job. Unfortunately, I kept it for over 30 days, so my order is not eligible for a refund."
,on,20,negative,"I have owned two basic Oral B elecric toothbrushes in the past... not the 100 USD+ ones, but basic.... I always loved them until they did not charge any longer.... This one I find no better than a drugstore battery charged e toothbrush. It is very challenging to turn on and off and so slippery to hold if you are a messy brusher...please try it out in a store before you buy to ensure it is the one for you."
,on,2,negative,"I purchased the Oral-B 1000 to replace my wife's old one, after 15 years it finely quit working, something went wrong with the on/off switch.  However there is a major difference in design, the old Oral-b had a raised switch and on the new one the switch is in a depression, very slight, but she is almost 80 and has trouble getting it on and off, if I had known I wouldn't have purchased it."
,on,24,positive,"The toothbrush worked great and held charge for days like it said in the instructions. i bought this toothbrush from Amazon on Jan 4th 2023. And about a week ago (May 17th 2023) I recharged it to full and now it will not hold charge through one brushing. i tried to recharge multiple times and it does the same thing over and over again. I have had good success with multiple Oral B products, but I really do not want to spend another $50 only after 4.5 months of lifetime on this toothbrush. Ugh!"
,on,2,negative,"11/2023: Purchased this brush late March & it’s dead as of mid-November. My disposable electric toothbrushes lasted longer than this thing. I will not purchase it again.I have had plenty of electric toothbrushes but never one with a round head. I chose the round head to force me to concentrate on each tooth versus just time for each quarter of my mouth. This brush has a 15 sec timer to nudge you along and as mentioned, the round head helps you focus on working on each tooth/gumline. My dental exams have improved, not to mention my gums. Replacement heads are easy and affordable to come by. My only complaint is that the wand is huge and the unit is loud. Other than that, you can’t beat the price for what you get."
,October,2023,negative,"I don't know if it's an issue with this practical style of braun electric toothbrush but it takes forever to recharged.  Otherwise, it works like any other Braun."
,on,14,negative,"I bought this to replace an older Oral B. Like many others have commented, it is hard to turn on and off. There is absolutely no excuse for Oral B to put this on the market KNOWING it was hard. Folks, this is where they get the phrase PROFIT OVER PEOPLE! I'm sure the company must have saved money by putting in a cheap, hard to press switch. I'll never buy another Oral B!"
