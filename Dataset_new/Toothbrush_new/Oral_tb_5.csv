2.0,March,2023,negative,Received toothbrush without soft gum massager. Just cross cross bristles in the pack. Wrongly shown in Amazon that brush having rubberised gum massager bristles at left and right bristle edge. Also bristles felt little hard (earlier used same brand but new brush bristles were not so hard). Think before you order online.
