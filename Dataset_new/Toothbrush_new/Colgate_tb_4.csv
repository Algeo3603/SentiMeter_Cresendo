3.0,December,2023,positive,"The product is obviously good. But it was delivered without any outer packaging. Since the toothbrushes are meant to be for oral hygiene, it was extremely unpleasant to see it delivered as is. I expected it to be properly packed"
2.0,February,2024,negative,"It flares very fast, say, after a month or two, so there is no point in using this product, as there is no value for money, a toothbrush should last atleast 3 months"
1.0,February,2024,negative,"Do not buy it even if was given for free, it hurts mouth and gums. Even after 3 hours I still feel it! One toothbrush costs around 20 rupees, and I have used toothbrushes that this cheap from local brands and even the one Colgate gives for free with toothpaste. Nothing was bad than this.The hard bristles literally impales cheek tissues and gums, horrible horrible stuff, I'm throwing this away in trash."

3.0,October,2018,positive,Got 6 pieces only for 99rs means nearly 16rs piece . So best according to budget but in clearly speaking it's an average quality brush .

1.0,March,2023,positive,"Giving it a review after using it for some time. The toothbrush is stiff, it scratch the gums and scrape away tooth enamel (the teeth's protective layer), which is something that cannot be replaced.So request to anyone reading this.
