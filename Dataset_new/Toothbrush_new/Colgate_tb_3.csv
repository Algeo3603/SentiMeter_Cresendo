1.0,October,2023,negative,i really love to use this product but today i got received with almost deforme product which almost ruin my hope even the delivery guy took rupees 10 as compulsory charge even if i tell him i buy prepaid. i suggest to  buy offline because of  such ignorance in handling product and behaviour of delivery guy.
3.0,January,2023,positive,Good product
3.0,February,2020,negative,"I've been using these kind of brushes for about 8 years now. They used to be very expensive at first, but now with all the buy 2 get 2 offers, the price has halved. They made the other Pack of 2 (total 8 brushes) out of stock, so I bought this. They didn't have a good deal so I spent Rs 150. (meh,  not happy about that). Try to buy the other pack with 8 brushes in total.Hope this review is helpful."
