2.0,July,2022,negative,"With normal use (not rough) for sensitive gums/teeth, this brush has most of bristles going bad within 15 days of use (twice a day). Not recommending for two reasons: [1] cost is too high [2] plastic use-n-throw within 2 weeks is bad for environment."

2.0,January,2022,negative,Cap is bigger in size than the brush. It is not matching at all. Don't buy thus product if you are trying to buy brush with cap.
2.0,April,2022,positive,"Sensidyne brushes are the best. These Colgate a cheaper compared to sensidyne tooth brush, but not worth it if you have sensitive teeth."

1.0,August,2022,negative,Dislike the product submitted
1.0,October,2020,neutral,The pack was open when delivered. Toothbrushes are new or used cant be said with certainity. Its useless and no return policy. Has to be thrown in dustbin.
1.0,September,2020,negative,I have received in damaged condition. I need replacement of this damaged product with good one. I already sent mail also. So far I have not received any positive feedback

1.0,January,2021,negative,"Horrible packaging, looks like used product. Looks dirty."
1.0,February,2018,neutral,Brought it thinking it is Colgate slim soft brush of mrp 50 each. But this is not those. Very hard and not comfortable to use. So not confused. Buy it if you use earlier.

1.0,September,2021,negative,"I bought this from supermarket, but It's not a quality product.It's not that soft and doesn't feel good while cleaning the teeth. See the condition in just 3 weeks of usage. Total money waste product."
1.0,September,2022,positive,
1.0,June,2021,negative,Seller claims that this are soft and gentle toothbrush but actually they are very hard toothbrush I have bought a pack about  15 days ago and I feel like I wasted my money
1.0,December,2019,positive,The most awful experience!!!
2.0,November,2020,negative,"I got this in Rs 88/- so it was good for the price. The brushes are fine. Covers are not so good. Open from behind, it doesn't fit properly and keeps sliding out. If each brush had a seperate packaging, it would be easier to store it. Haven't used the brush yet so can't give feedback on that, will update later."
1.0,October,2019,negative,Delivered sensodyne brushes instead of coalgate
1.0,July,2020,negative,What I received is not soft bristles while on packet it mentioned soft bristles. Seems it is a fake toothbrush selling as soft bristles in name of colgate.
,October,2021,negative,"The package is half open, the toothbrushes are dirty. I had to throw everything away."
,June,2022,negative,"If you can get over them smelling like a moldy Barbie swimming pool set, then go for it. I used them once and never again. Too bad, cool pastel colours and brushing was fine."
,August,2023,negative,The bristles of this super soft toothbrush were not as soft as I was expecting. The bristles then harden after use.
,June,2023,negative,"Package came in damaged, taped up, cracked plastic and water damage on the back. There is a smell to the back of the packaging, will be returning."
,April,2023,negative,The product arrived open and taped together. The product is not for sale in North America and appeared to have been used.
,on,1,negative,The packaging was different than what is listed here. There or words in the Chinese language. The bristles are nice and soft but the handle is where the smell is coming from. So every time I brush I smelled that toxic smell. Amazon wants me to physically return it so that they can resell it so beware. You might just get my old ones
,on,11,positive,"These are totally mislabeled as ""soft."" They are not. I've bought these in the past, and was happy with the softness, which helped me with my sensitive teeth and gums... But now they've changed. They aren't nearly as soft as they used to be. They hurt my gums... So my search for properly ""soft"" brushes continues..."
,on,28,neutral,"I wanted a gentle soft toothbrush for my sensitive teeth and gums. This is not soft. Medium at best. Fine otherwise, but I still have to buy a soft toothbrush,  so money wasted for me."
,on,1,negative,"As toothbrushes go these really are gentle and do the job, However, they are NOT battery operated. So don't expect that when you make your purchase."
,on,24,neutral,"Not ultra soft, as advertised. More like your standard soft toothbrush."
,on,13,positive,Average
,on,14,negative,I don't know who decided to call those sensitive tooth or soft brushes. They are the opposite.
,on,2,negative,I would not buy these toothbrushes. They are not meant for US market. Poor quality… not durable…
,on,23,negative,"They’re cheap and I see why. The side bristles fray so easily and then they’ll make small cuts and abrasions on the sides of your mouth despite the bristles supposedly being soft. The whole point of having soft bristles is for heavy handed people but these clearly aren’t soft at all. I’m just gonna go back to the old soft bristle toothbrush brand i used before and toss these out, they’re absolute garbage."
,on,10,negative,"The actual product package was cut open along the bottom and a big hole in the outer plastic.Might as well taken the toothbrushes out of the packing and threw them in a box to ship.Fortunately, it doesn't look like the actual toothbrushes were damaged."
,on,28,neutral,The hardness of the toothbrush is definitely not ultra soft. It is more of a normal/medium brush. The brush causes gum pain and bleeding
,on,9,neutral,"These felt like typical soft toothbrushes, and didn't seem extra soft at all.  Ok bargain, but if you are looking for those super soft bristles, that are like velvet, these aren't it."
,on,4,neutral,"These are not soft toothbrushes, medium at best. The heads are small slightly bigger than a children's toothbrush. The packaging clearly stated not for sale in the USA. I guess, except for Amazon"
,on,18,neutral,Not extra soft......
,on,26,negative,"Extremely disappointed in these toothbrushes.  I didn't look at the country of origin closely and the tooth brushes themselves were very stiff and not for sensitivity teeth/gums.  Looking at the markings these should have been ultra soft bristles, instead they are probably the equivalent of medium.  Very stiff."
,on,4,negative,These were very hard and made my gums bleed.
