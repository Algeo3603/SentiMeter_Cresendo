1.0,March,2023,negative,"These toothbrushes are far from soft. There isn't 1 part of this toothbrush that is soft.For those of you with sensitive gums or teeth, I would not recommend this. I was completely shocked at how hard this product was. I had to give the rest of the pack away, and now I'm searching for an ACTUAL soft toothbrush. I'm quite disappointed with Oral B."
