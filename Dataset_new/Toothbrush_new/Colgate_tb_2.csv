3.0,February,2024,positive,Quality and price is not reasonable little bit high
1.0,January,2024,negative,This is the worst toothbrush i have seen. It is not at all soft bristles. Moreover it is mere a designer brush and doesn't fulfill the requirement.I couldn't imagine that colgate manufacturing such useless toothbrush.Please don't buy.Thanks.
3.0,February,2024,neutral,Not very soft.. Definitely not ultra soft... Go for the FOAM one from different brand..
3.0,February,2024,neutral,"Not as soft as expected, there are softer better brushes"
3.0,December,2023,negative,"I tried this as I read that this brush has many more bristles than other brushes, but this is too soft to use after using the standard type for 3 decades. I'll try for another month and will update the review if I feel any different. It reaches the corners of mouth much better, but it's just too soft."
3.0,December,2023,negative,Not worth of money little bit coastly as compared to other brushes and brushes aren‚Äôt soft
3.0,October,2023,positive,"Old looking Colour's,.Sometimes feels hard.."
3.0,October,2023,positive,Okay
3.0,March,2023,negative,"I was looking for a replacement to Colgate Charcoal toothbrush which I am using for years. I ordered this after seeing the description and reviews, expecting softer bristles but turns out it has similar softness to charcoal one, just that bristle density is high. It does feel a bit soft but for initial few uses only.A bit disappointed with the brush, considering its costing more than double of what charcoal one costs and the term ultrafoam it a bit misleading. So, I'll be going back to the previous one.Only pros would be ergonomic soft handle and high density of bristles.You may go for it, if you want wider coverage i.e. cover more area in less time."
2.0,January,2024,negative,Bristles are NOT soft. After 4 days shape distorted
3.0,September,2023,positive,Feels like a medium soft not a ultra soft  brush
2.0,November,2023,positive,"I bought it after seeing ads on Instagram then I found out that 10k plus bristlles are good at cleaning teeths but, honestly I would go simple brush with soft brittles."
3.0,July,2021,positive,"Bought this toothbrush for myself and my wife and we were happy with the coloring scheme.The brush head was very small but it helped in taking the right amoumt of tooth paste and we never had the problem of taking extra toothpaste than required.The bristles were very densely packed, never used anything like this before. This certainly gave me much better confidence in cleaning each tooth and I was able to concentrate on the right areas for cleaning.The bristles were very soft and never harsh on the gums. At the same time the dense and pointed bristles was able to clean much better than my previous regular sized toothbrushes.But I have been notificing this issue of bristles in the lower end of the toothbrush being bent of at angle when taken right out of the box. I saw this on the enamel protection series as well. This looks like quality wasn't taken care much by Colgate. In this pack of 2 only 1 brush had this bent brsitles but seems common in the new series from Colgate.Handle of the toothbrush is soft to grip and strong to prevent bending.Overall a good toothbrush for cleaning tooth, but price is higher and quality of bristles alignment is something that should be looked upon."
2.0,December,2023,positive,Bristles size is too small. Colgate gentle enamal is much better toothbrush.
1.0,January,2024,negative,I need a soft brustal toothbrush but it's not soft and what I expect it was not that tooth brush so please don't buy it don't waste your money
1.0,February,2024,negative,Expensive without any use
1.0,January,2024,negative,"The bristles are too close, even after brushing my teeth are yellowish, and I find trapped food particles.Useless toothbrush."
3.0,June,2023,positive,Awesome
2.0,September,2023,negative,"The Bristles are hard & clogged, they do not spread at all while brushing, and stay as a lump."
3.0,February,2023,neutral,I would have given four for my first experience with this brush but when I ordered the second time the brush didn't feel as soft as what I've got at first time.
1.0,January,2024,neutral,As shown in image product not same Don‚Äôt fool the customer
1.0,November,2023,negative,"I am telling you the truth I have this pair of toothbrush and they r so much hard , literally very hard.  It's a lie that it is Soft or ultra soft . Nhi hai Bhai ye soft ek dam kharab hai. Nhi hota viswas to khareed ke dekh loüòä"
3.0,January,2023,positive,THE BRISTLES CAME OFF FROM THE BRUSH WHEN I KEPT IT IN THE TRAVEL BAG DURING MY TRAVEL VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE QUALITY
1.0,November,2023,negative,"One of the worst product from Colgate. The description says ultra soft, which is a joke.May be it has too many bristles too close to each other which makes the brush super hard and punishing on gums.This being one of the most expensive brush, its absolutely not worth."
2.0,September,2023,neutral,Not ‚Äòso soft‚Äô as per description
3.0,October,2022,positive,No bang for the buck but good brushes but Colgate should have made it in India or any other country than China. Will buy them if they would be made in India.
1.0,January,2024,positive,Worst product. Dont buy.
1.0,December,2023,negative,I m totally disappointedWaste of money
1.0,September,2023,negative,"Forget ultra soft, this brush made my gums bleed within 2 days of trying. The head is so small that it doesn‚Äôt go to corners, and when I did try to make it reach to the corners, it hurt my gums so bad that it will take at least 2 weeks to recover. I just don‚Äôt understand why would you do this, Colgate? I‚Äôm so hurt!"
1.0,December,2023,positive,Poor quality
1.0,September,2023,negative,This toothbrush is so expensive but is totally useless1. It is so small that you will feel like its a childs toothbrush2. The bristles are so soft that they are quiet unsatisfactory to use it feels like brushing with a cotton3. No tongue cleaner4. The bristles come off while brushing a super irritating feeling
3.0,October,2022,neutral,Image shows ultra soft but it is little bit hard. This is may be medium. So not fit to children's.
1.0,October,2023,negative,It's a rubbish thing ... I will not even call it a toothbrush. It's absolutely inconvenient and harsh. It is not good for tooth cleaning at all. Wondering how can this be launched without a trial !! Ekdam bakwas.
3.0,October,2021,negative,Bristles are soft but they are joint in a way that it makes brushing as if it‚Äôs with hard bristles. Design is cute but better toothbrushes are available in the market with price way lesser than this. Not helpful if you have super sensitive gums which tend to easily swell.
3.0,November,2022,neutral,No softness was there as I hope
1.0,November,2023,neutral,Do not reach to hard to reach teath areas in mouth.
1.0,October,2023,negative,It says ultra soft but not soft at all. The bristles are so hard my gums started to bleed during the first use. This is the worst toothbrush i have ever used.

1.0,September,2023,negative,When used for the first time the brush (bristles) started coming out one by one.IT GOT STUCK IN BETWEEN THE TEETH.It not even worth for 1RS.Shame on golgate.
1.0,August,2023,positive,"While the brush was good for the first few days, the roots of the bristles turned yellow and start to smell of plastic that is of terrible quality"
2.0,April,2023,negative,The bursh brisles are getting out. It's not upto the expectations.
3.0,August,2022,negative,Since it's size is small so softness seems harder.
3.0,July,2022,negative,The feathers are coming off. Not fixed to the plastic handle properly.
3.0,May,2022,positive,
2.0,December,2022,negative,"I like this product , and i used this from many years , this is the first time happened like this , please maintain some products build quality, do something for this damaged product"
3.0,June,2022,positive,Very soft and confy to use for ppl with braces but not very long lasting
1.0,November,2023,positive,
1.0,October,2023,negative,It does not provide a good brushing experience.
1.0,August,2023,positive,You can easily get good toothbrush in 60rs from local shop... Company has mentioned that this toothbrush have soft bristles which is completely false.
1.0,September,2023,negative,Everything is wrong with this brush. The head size and cleaning process every single thing is wrong. Buy at your own risk.
2.0,January,2023,negative,Too much expensive not worthNever buy online this product from any app.West of money.
3.0,May,2022,positive,Handle is too long for the kids.
1.0,June,2023,negative,"Well, to begin with, this toothbrush has a ball like head with tightly packed bristles in a small space with a flower design that can clean everything except your teeth, or gums for that matter.Colgate has to get serious inputs from consumers before making such products."
2.0,February,2023,positive,Its big...can be good for 5 plus age kids .
3.0,August,2022,positive,Nice
2.0,September,2022,negative,"It is infact very soft. However whats the use of a product if the bristles start to fall off in first use, that too in my mouth while brushing. 4-5 others started falling flat. Who expects this quality from colgate"
1.0,September,2023,negative,It‚Äôs is very hard
1.0,July,2021,negative,1. The product description says it has small head so that it becomes easy to reach the teeth at the back. So I switched from sensodyne to this. But this did not solve the purpose. Plus the bristles!2. The bristles are so densely packed that it becomes difficult to move the head around the teeth.3. And the middle pink part as you can see in the picture has thicker bristles than the white border ones. Design is just so wierd. My sensodyne is far better than this and much softer.CONCLUSION- I'm gonna use this brush to clean something else than my teeth. Use sensodyne it's nuch better. I'll probably have to change my technique so as to clean the back teeth well too.Please brush your teeth twice.YouTube- there's a channel called supa dental. He talks about how to correctly brush your teeth. I watched that video and it really does help.
1.0,October,2022,negative,"This tooth brush is a health hazard! It's bristles come off each time I use it and it's a risk that the plastic bristles would be swallowed! Amazon should remove this item listing urgently as swallowing plastic is a serious health hazard!Also, the base of the bristles become dirty and you can't clean the brush well because the bristles are so fragile that they come off.This is a total disastrous product, stay away from it if you don't love to swallow plastic!"
3.0,February,2021,positive,I have extra sensitive teeth. The head of the brush is ok but the bristles are not soft enough to not be abrasiveI am afraid this will damage my teeth more
2.0,November,2022,negative,"It is the same as other 20-30‚Çπ toothbrush, only it costs more.In my opinion it‚Äôs waste of money !!!"
1.0,July,2023,negative,There are toothbrushes way better than this also it says it's soft but it's not
1.0,July,2023,neutral,The bristles part is very very small. As a result it doesn't cover much of the mouth cavity and one will have to toil hard while brushing. Very expensive.
3.0,November,2021,positive,extra soft but very small head. probably good for kids
1.0,August,2023,positive,Online payment krne ke baad bhi COD liya gya
3.0,August,2021,negative,Not as good as i assume . After a week it get more hard
3.0,April,2021,positive,Softness 4.5‚≠êThinkness 3.8‚≠êValue for Money 3‚≠êGood to use and no harshness while using in gums.
2.0,October,2021,neutral,"Main function of a brush is to clean. No matter how much foam it produces, if it can't reach all the places, it becomes pointless. Which is exactly what happens in the case of this brush. Please look for some other kind and don't waste your money on this."
2.0,December,2022,negative,Not good
1.0,August,2023,negative,Durability is very poor
1.0,December,2022,neutral,The toothbrush is neither ultra soft nor very gentle to the gums. The bristles may be soft individually but are too densely attached to the brushhead for comfort. The item is imported from China and is expensive compared to other similar toothbrushes.Overall we don't feel comfortable using these brushes.
1.0,July,2023,positive,Seller give me. Damage box but  product is ok don't do again
3.0,August,2021,negative,After brushing of 1 month bristel gets harder.

1.0,May,2023,neutral,"The brush is not soft at all and the shape will make you uncomfortable to brush, very costly"
2.0,September,2021,negative,"I thought that the brushes would be tiny size . But it is as big as the adult toothbrush . So , my child can't hold it properly . And not so soft as I desired .I am very disappointed with the product"
3.0,June,2021,positive,I would rate it as average product.
1.0,July,2023,neutral,There is no packaging for the product.
3.0,May,2021,neutral,I don't find anything different or good to mention.
1.0,June,2023,negative,Don't buy it. Will irritate you everyday because of its small size
1.0,February,2022,negative,"Bristles are really soft but they're arranged in a way that, when u brush, they don't separate and clear the dirt against teeth or in-between, not cleaning much AT ALL.I had to brush again with old toothbrush. Need to buy a new different brush.Waste of money.To describe it exactly, it's like brushing teeth with soft rubber sponge, it rubs against teeth well, really soft, just won't clean a thing."
2.0,June,2022,positive,Not soft at all My Bamboo brush which is eco-friendly is better than this one.
2.0,September,2022,positive,"Bristles coming out from first use, otherwise ok.."
2.0,April,2022,negative,The product is too much costly for its quality.. I will never buy it again.
2.0,September,2022,negative,it's too expensive.
2.0,February,2022,neutral,No difference in quality than 25 rupees brush only difference is design. Honestly 1 brush shouldn't cost more than 50 inr.
1.0,May,2023,negative,Not worth buying this product.It is expensive as well as its bristles are not soft.
3.0,March,2021,neutral,Not value for money..doesnt fulfill the required job.
3.0,May,2021,negative,Not so great
3.0,January,2021,positive,I am satisfied with the product quality but it is overpriced

2.0,March,2022,negative,"The toothbrush head is too small to do clean your teeth properly, disappointing quality"
1.0,March,2023,neutral,Most waste brushes available in the market.not at all soft & comfortable. don't waste ur money
3.0,January,2021,positive,Nice quality but not soft as expected
1.0,June,2023,positive,
1.0,March,2023,positive,"Bilkul bhi soft nhi hai, is se better to 20 Rs wala hai"
2.0,November,2021,neutral,"Bezels are very Hard, normal 20 Rs Colgate Brush is far better than this.I don't recommend this"
1.0,April,2021,negative,"Had bought it seeing the reviews and the innovative concept, but this is not worth the money. The head is too little and the neck connecting the head is very weak- so when pressure is given on the back molars, the neck just bends so much that it seems like it'll break any time. Thinking what will I do with the other one- thinking of use it for my 5 yr old son.Not buying again."
