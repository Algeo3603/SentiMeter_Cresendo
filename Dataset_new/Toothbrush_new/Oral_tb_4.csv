2.0,January,2022,negative,"grip design is faulty, I always buy a P&G product as I trust the brand for quality, they have a great product portfolio but the toothbrush is a bad piece of designing the grip is faulty and the tongue cleaner placed behind the bristles are so rough that they have cut the inside of my cheeks, very bad designing and material used"
3.0,March,2021,negative,Received the pack few days ago however bristles have already started losing their shape in 2-3 days only of the child using it. Didnt expect that from Oral-B.

1.0,April,2023,negative,"Bristles are very hard and small in length that makes them extra stiff and puts lots of pressure on teeth and gums, i was highly mis lead by the extrathin bristles mentioned in the product name."
3.0,July,2021,negative,Very hard bristles. Don't buy.
1.0,July,2021,negative,Rubbish.... I ordered because advertisement pictures show clearly uneven bristle level for better cleaning and raised end level for hard to reach ends... But what I got was a completely plain level bristle.Cannot return it also due to it's policy... So complete waste.Package is exactly the same as shown in Ad picture.... But the product bristles are different. Can't blame amazon... It's oral B 's fault. Won't ever buy any oral B product as they either fool people or are pathetic at quality control.

1.0,July,2017,negative,"This product is being marketed for ""sensitive"" teeth which is just nonsense. This bristles are quite hard & stiff, and if you suffer from gum bleeding or toothaches, you should definitely avoid this one - every time I use this brush, I end up with bleeding gums. Go for ""ultra soft"" one from Oral-B, which is much softer than this one & much more comfortable to use."
