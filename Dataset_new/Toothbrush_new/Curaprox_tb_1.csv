3.0,July,2023,negative,"Not worth the money ,bristles are not as soft as mentioned ,couldâ€™ve got a better buy in lesser amount !"

,October,2021,negative,"No me llego el color solicitado, el producto es bueno pero no cumplen con lo que muestran, los tiempos de entrega fueron muy satisfactorios llego un dia antes de la fecha"
,December,2023,negative,"Verwende sie schon lÃ¤nger.Bei einer Chemo braucht man eine weiche ZahnbÃ¼rste, weil die Schleimhaut empfindlich ist."
,January,2024,positive,small and pricey
,on,20,neutral,Iâ€™ve never seen this package before ðŸ¤¨ itâ€™s something so personal that Iâ€™m afraid to use it.
,on,24,positive,"These Curaprox toothbrushes are not all that bad as far as toothbrushes go! The only real complaint I had w/ the brush is the fact that the individual bristles seem to either break off or just fall out!I did like how soft the brush itself is!That makes it nicer on the teeth and gums!And I even liked how ergonomic the brush was and how it felt in my hand!So, if not for the issue of losing the bristles I think this brush would offer tremendous value for the money!But because of that I give the Curaprox toothbrush 3 stars!"
,on,14,neutral,"Itâ€™s extremely accurate when they say itâ€™s soft, however it doesnâ€™t really clean your teeth it more feels like a little polish. I donâ€™t recommend itâ€™s just overall not doing what itâ€™s supposed too."
,October,2023,negative,I ordered this on by mistake. I had meant to have ordered 5460 which is ulta soft.
,on,15,negative,"This isn't special. Maybe it's my fault. I was hoping for a super, surprisingly - soft toothbrush. It's just an overpriced, basic soft toothbrush. Mine was purple with yellow bristles. There really isn't anything else to say. Don't get your hopes up!!"
,on,18,neutral,"Orange works as well as white, but I wouldnâ€™t have ordered it if I had known I wasnâ€™t getting the color I preferred.  Too much hassle to send back.  Iâ€™ll save it to use when I eat citrus."
,on,22,positive,Toothbrush is effective as described BUT the ALL-IMPORTANT image in the Ad was of a blue brush with white(ish) bristles.  Received a Green Pea-Soup-colored brush with bright orange bristles.  Every time I brush my teeth I think of Shrek grinning after eating a bag of cheetos.  Just make sure the photo of the item matches what's sent.  Makes me more hesitant before ordering something else.
,on,4,negative,"This toothbrush is definitely one of the softest but is awkwardly small :( I don't know if it's because I have a big tuft mouth or what, but the toothbrush is too small for me! Still gave 3 stars for softness and quick shipping!"
