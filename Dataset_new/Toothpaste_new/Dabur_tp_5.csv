1.0,June,2021,negative,"Not sure what is the deal with this one but I bought it thinking itâ€™s chemical free. But somehow, i got pain in my roots after using it. Replaced it with my usual Colgate and the pain was gone. I think there is extra sugar that started creeping in the roots. I still have 2 and half paste left over. Not going to use it at all."

1.0,April,2021,neutral,It says I'm the front that it doesn't have any parabens and fluoride but doesn't mention about the other harmful ingredients which can be clearly seen at the back of the pack. Very cunningly they haven't showed the back part of the pack.
