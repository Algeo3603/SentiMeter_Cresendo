2.0,January,2024,positive,It's OK OK...we have try once
3.0,September,2023,positive,Value for money but thickness it should improve
3.0,January,2022,negative,"This seems to be just some run-of-the-mill toothpaste except for adding a bit of tulsi flavour.In the ingredient list itself one can see ""flavour containing tulsi oil"" is one of the minor ingredients. If this toothpaste is really anti-bacterial, it may be due to some other ingredient, not tulsi flavour.Actually I developed some teeth problems, which may or may not be due to switching to this toothpaste. [Just as India was recovering from the COVID-19 wave, I just bought whatever toothpaste was available.]"
3.0,April,2023,positive,Wast
1.0,November,2023,negative,I thought I am buying pure herbal toothpaste but SLS is there in this toothpaste which is very harmful chemical.
1.0,March,2022,negative,I bought this product seeing the Dabur name. Didn't think of checking the ingredients and to my surprise I see these detergent and shampoo grade chemicals in the ingredients list.The so called TULSI mentioned in the branding is plain rubbish. It has a 'flavour containing Tulsi oilI use Dabur red paste so thought of giving this a try. I should have checked through the product photos.Sodium Lauryl Sulphate and Sodium silicate! Dabur you clearly did not get any alternative.I will use this to clean old brass utensils or silver jewellery. Not for brushing teeth.

1.0,April,2021,negative,I bought it by seeing no fluoride and parabens but when I received the product and checked its ingredients it has artificial sweetener artificial flavours and artificial colours with sodium silicate which is similar to fluoride so please don't buy this although it is cheap but the ingredients are not safe for daily consumption. You should buy Patanjali dant Kanti instead
3.0,August,2021,negative,"Do you remember our mother and grandmother  saying not to bite tulsi leaves. Reason is it has mercury in it, which is bad for teethThen Why Tulsi in toothpaste ? As per ayurveda tusli is not good for your teethHit the like button if you agree and make people aware"
