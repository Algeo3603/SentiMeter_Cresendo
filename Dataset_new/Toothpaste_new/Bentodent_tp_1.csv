3.0,August,2023,negative,taste goodcleaning teeth averagefreshness averagerecommended NOI am confused about the thing there is no symbol of veg or non-veg. I am not going to buy it again.
2.0,September,2023,negative,"Has No Foam, so turns fully liquidy while Brushing, which then doesn't clean many areas of the mouth. The Mint flavor/smell exists only while Brushing, but disappears immediately once you flush your mouth with water. Absolutely does nothing to maintain Fresh Breath as all other toothpastes do! It's just like using a piece of raw charcoal to brush on teeth. It's the First Brand of Toothpaste that I actually threw out!"
2.0,November,2023,negative,Just a waste of money doest not work.

3.0,October,2022,positive,It reduces sensitivity thats fine & clean properly 1.but all my tooth turned into yellow after using this paste. 2.Overpriced
3.0,October,2021,negative,The product quality is top notch. Easily migrated from the regular toothpaste. The only problem is of the packaging. The tube head cracks up. I have had two purchases but both of the time the tube cracks up & creates wastage & hassles. If the company focuses on a different package design this product can reach better success.

1.0,May,2023,negative,I always go for Indian product. I bites activated charcoal paste trust me I have very bad experience. Though sound natural but but I don‚Äôt feel a good experience after brushing teeth. The back ingredients you use spoil the basin which not removed easily. I don‚Äôt feel the freshness after brushing. You guys need to work out more with the product
2.0,March,2023,negative,While brushing feel like use roasted tobacco powder because of black color
2.0,October,2022,negative,"I tried to give this toothpaste a chance, I really did. But it sucks. I have an electric toothbrush and even that can‚Äôt make this toothpaste spread. It just gets stuck to your teeth sometimes. I couldn‚Äôt feel any freshness after brushing."

3.0,November,2021,neutral,I have been using this for 2 months only minor results are visible
1.0,August,2021,negative,"I bught it after watching fittuber video. Used it for some days and began to see that teeth were becoming yellowish brown. I thought the reason could be something elase and started doing oil pulling and other things to remove the yellow stain. I somehow stopped using the paste forthe reason that, feel after brush was of something incomplete and teeth weren't smooth. My father who has been using the paste along with me found thathis teeth too started becoming yellow and they were almost brown in colour. This alarmed him and he stopped using the paste altogether. I am not questioning whether the paste is natural or not. I have no idea to be frank. But for sure from my and my father's experience this toothpaste for some reason makes teeth yellow."

1.0,July,2021,negative,"Hi,I hardly write any reviews for any of the products I buy and it's my first review ever.I feel many people are going for this toothpaste from a different platform and even using it.This toothpaste is indeed foam free and all-natural (Seems to be at least)But it has very tiny particles in it which will damage your teeth' enamel coating which can be critical in long run.I had this toothpaste tested by the dentist and he says the same not to do this.please don't waste your money on this at least.I bought this used it for one time and then put it in the dustbin"

1.0,March,2023,negative,"This toothpaste lacks some components. This is the reason I couldn't eat anything sweet, led to toothache. Stopped using it and went back to Patanjali. Fixed my toothache issue in a week.Thrown this into the trash can"
3.0,May,2021,neutral,Don't know how it works maybe later show result

1.0,September,2020,negative,I got this toothpaste in best condition.. it was sealed so i was happy but then At first I was skeptical...As It's all natural i thought it will show results after 1 months but within 2 days i can feel and see my teeth were clean and whiter... I couldn't believe because it never foamed in my mouth but I'm shocked to see the resultsReview after 1 monthPlz don't use this paste.. it makes teeth yellow..and cause ulcer in mouth.. i stopped using after feeling changes in my mouth
1.0,December,2021,negative,"Charcoal is very toxic for teeth. Makes them sensitive. Sadly return isn't possible and I am stuck with two of them. American Dental Association has not found any evidence that charcoal toothpaste is safe or effective, and it may actually harm the teeth and gums. Charcoal toothpaste is advertised as a whitening agent that can remove particles from the teeth, but this is a misleading claim"
,July,2023,positive,The product is okay so so
,on,14,negative,Horrible it is not good do not buy this after my first use today my teeth became sensitive it causes you to feel the cold which makes it a little painful. Do not buy this it‚Äôs horrible bad product I wasted money tossing in the garbage üóëÔ∏è!!!
