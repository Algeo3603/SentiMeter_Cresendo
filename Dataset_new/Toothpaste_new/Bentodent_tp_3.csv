3.0,January,2024,neutral,No feel like tooth paste ... feeling like manjan
1.0,January,2024,neutral,"The toothpaste is sub standard one, writing this review after 10 days of usage. Does not feel fresh after brushing, does not actually feel as if brushed or not. Not recommended, even the teeth does not get cleaned properly. Improvisation is needed."
3.0,November,2023,negative,Not good as charcoal.
3.0,November,2022,negative,"I USED DAILY , BUT BANISH BAD BREATH TAG LINE MEANING LESS , SOME TIME YOU FEEL VERY BAD when someone comments regarding your bad breath"
1.0,November,2023,positive,Taste is good but it requires in large quantity and its non foaming toothpaste
2.0,July,2022,neutral,"Doesn't clean. Plaque is not removed. You need to brush more than two times a day, it feels so...No harmful ingredients - thank you. But, honestly, at the end of the day, I do not want my tongue to keep rolling between teeth for the uneasy feeling of plaque on the teeth.Not buying again. Will be trying other options."

1.0,July,2023,negative,Horrible taste.. feels like eating a super sweet paan first thing in the morning !!!
2.0,August,2021,positive,It will not help you to keep freshness long lasting. I was using Dant kanti before this and now again came back to it. This tooth paste is good for its flavor and may be for its ingredients but it will say to brush your teeth atleast three times. Good while you are going for bed
