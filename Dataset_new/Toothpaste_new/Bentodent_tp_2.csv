3.0,January,2024,neutral,Product is fine I think I have found this toothpaste one in itâ€™s kind that doesnâ€™t have any chemicals in it. But at least use some ayurvedic things in it clove or something more like dant Mannan type
3.0,December,2023,positive,Feels good to use SLS and praben free toothpaste...made my teeth yellow I think
2.0,February,2024,positive,No need to add stevia for sweet taste. This natural sweetener is also recently known for bad health effects. Should remove it as this paste is for health conscious people. Otherwise it is a good alternative for foamy pastes.
3.0,September,2023,negative,"Toothpaste when used in the morning, mouth is fresh for couple of hours and you start feeling as if you didnâ€™t brush for rest of the day ( maybe because of less or no fluoride)It leads to bad breath and smells at times.Heard from a dentist friend that no fluoride toothpaste issues in long term can cause issues.So, I use Meswak during the day and Bentodent in the night before going to bed."

2.0,May,2023,negative,"The freshness after you brush is missing in it I can feel dirty teeth and bad ardour after sometime. Just knowing that there is no chemical is not enough, the soul purpose of the toothpaste is missing ðŸ˜• ðŸ˜¢ ðŸ˜” ðŸ’”."
3.0,May,2022,neutral,I like this paste coz it has no fluoride. It's not foamy but alright by me. However I hv problem with the tube neck. It always break on pressure as we push the paste out. So it leaks from the crack. I advice company to make better quality tube.
1.0,October,2023,negative,"Doesn't serve the purpose, after using 1 week, teeth sensitive increased and cleaning also not satisfactory. Do not recommend this toothpaste to anyone."

3.0,July,2021,negative,Using from few weeks. Paste seems to be good but tube quality is really horrible. Both of the tube's neck broke up automatically. Now pastes are drying up. This problem is not faced by me only but others also who bought.
1.0,September,2023,negative,Add more cardmom to your cardmom flavoured toothpaste and add more mint to your menthol toothpaste  . Otherwise itâ€™s just a waste of money. Very minor smell of cardmom or mint

1.0,April,2023,negative,It seems to have dust particles in it. when one brushes one can feel the dust type particles in the mouth. It gives very unpleasant feeling and may also damage the enamel of the Teeth.  I have stopped using it and strongly not recommended.

3.0,April,2021,negative,"Tube breaks they havelowered the build quality, using from long time but now not happy"
1.0,June,2023,negative,"go for any other natural paste. this is tally tasteless, resultless. dont get trapped."
1.0,November,2021,negative,I'm a regular user of this toothpaste but each time the tube cracks after using it for few days. Initially thought maybe the tube cracked due to my fault but each time it continues to happen then I understood the quality of tube is not good. We are paying way more price than regular paste... Why can't the company maintain a minimum standard in its packaging? Even though these many people have raised their concern about tube... They are not making any change!
