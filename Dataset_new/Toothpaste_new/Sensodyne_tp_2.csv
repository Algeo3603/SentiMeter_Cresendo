,on,26,neutral,"This review is similar to a previous customer review. I ordered 2 tubes. They arrived wrapped in plastic, they were not in a box. When I opened one of the tubes, it did not have a protective cover like all toothpaste I buy. When checked the back to see where it was made, the country was no where to be found. I am returning them."

,on,10,positive,Normally there is a silver seal on the tube opening.
,on,12,neutral,"I ordered 2 tubes.  They arrived wrapped in saran wrap, they were not in a box. When I opened one of the tubes, it did not have a protective cover like all toothpaste I buy. When checked the back to see where it was made, the country was no where to be found on the website. I am returning them."
,on,28,negative,Sensodyne products are the only tooth and mouthcare items that I use because of extremely sensitive teeth.  I had some tooth pain recently despite just getting a clean bill of health from my dentist.  I used the Rapid Relief for several days but it showed me no  relief.  At that point I decided to go back to the regular Sensodyne toothpaste and my pain from sensisensitiis gone.  This new toothpaste doesn't work as well for me.
,on,29,neutral,Not a full size tube of toothpaste
,on,21,positive,"Would not buy it again , Iâ€™ll go back to the one from Canada it works better ."
,on,23,neutral,It did not indicate in the product that this item was manufactured  in India. I could smell the toothpaste  before I opened  the package. Also the original  description  indicated it was larger sized. Now it says 80 grams which is half the size . I thought I was getting 2 4.2 oz tubes not 2 80 gram packages.
,on,9,positive,I thought the ad was for a larger size because of the 80 gms. Lesson learned.
,on,12,positive,Was to much money
