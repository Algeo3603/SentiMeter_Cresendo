3.0,January,2021,neutral,Donot believe on TV advertising of any product.Don't buy until you are advised by a dentist to use this toothpaste.I am using sensodyne for more than 2 years and not a little difference I felt about sensitivity of my teeth.You can visit a dentist in cost of two 100  gm toothpaste tube. So I advise first dentist.üòúüòú
