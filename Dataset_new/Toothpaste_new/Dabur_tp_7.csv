1.0,July,2022,negative,"Worst product, it caused cracked and swollen lips and doctor confirmed inflammation of lips for which he give steroid based tenovate ointment and suggest to stop using this toothpaste. Since I bought family pack and after my dabur red toothpaste is over which has no issues, i thought of trying Dant rakshak once again and to my surprise all family members have issues:1. My lip cracked and swollen once again and post 2 days of tenovate i am ok and no issues with other toothpaste.2. My daughter had gum ulcer and heeled once toothpaste replaced along with same for other family members.Suggest to be cautious while using this toothpaste as it causes inflammation"

1.0,June,2021,negative,"Thought of writing review after prolonged use,  brought this pack of 3 thinking its ayurvedic so no worry.Detailed ExperiencesSmell is good.The quantity applied to brush has to be very very minute(like a small medicine tablet)If not burning sensation in mouth and tear/rip of soft areas inside mouth.While brushing you can feel slippery noise between teeth and brush shows the paste has no good grip with teeth.All members in family started complaining regarding the bad choice.Out of 3 not even one paste tube is finished till now.Had to buy an alternate brand paste for daily use.If you guys are thinking of buying this,  i would suggest buying a smaller quantity and pack of1.Purchase made was 186rsBut considering the unused quantity left/wastage i  provide 1 star."

2.0,August,2021,negative,"Dabur, I blindly go towards ùsing dabur products right from hair oils to antiseptic liquids. That belief in dabur also made me choose this product. Using dabur red toothpaste in the earlier I tried this too.. the first tube was indeed awesome and we had such a good experience with fresh breath but the 2nd tube I didn't knew what went wrong, using this paste is causing mouth sores and cracked tongues.Initially I didn't notice that the mouth sores are the effect of tooth paste but later after on and off usage of the toothpaste in between made me confirm it.Even a little amount of toothpaste is having a great impact, like brushing it once only is causing numbness of taste, mouth sores, lips corners are absolutely burning, the tongue cracks are far evidentI am very disappointed that this product leashed down the hopes on the other products as well."
