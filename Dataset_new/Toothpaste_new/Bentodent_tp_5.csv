3.0,May,2018,positive,"Seller: Indian Dental OrganizationPrice: 170/-Delivery:  6 days (Incl Sunday), 50/- Delivery Fee, BangalorePackage: Came in big box for a small tube!, no damageRecommended: yes, if you love foam-less brushing!After using Dabur paste for several years, recently came to light that it contains Methyl paraben which is on controversy discussion (whether it is harmful). So I don't want to take any risk any further and this paste came in to light. The paste contents appear all natural and almost no Preservatives (Going by the ingredient list). The paste looks grey color and it gets broken into pieces (True!) while you squeeze the tube to the bristles of your brush!. First time accidental flip will let all the paste fall on to your toes.This paste has no foam. Not sure if this is because of the lack of the preservatives. Foamless brushing is a bit risky if you have Medium or Hard brush type. You could possibly end up losing the tooth enamel!. I personally don't recommend this paste unless you have the awareness or if you have the habit of brushing so roughly!. The after brush feel is good because of Menthol. However, I feel that the menthol presence is little excess!.I recommend this product very much for it's complete natural. Even the famous Dabur Red advertises Ayurvedic but contains chemicals!, while this is free from all preservatives. However, foamless and the high price is the reason for 3 star. Hope my review is useful. Buy Natural and Be natural!"
1.0,December,2023,negative,My gums started to pain after a week of usage
3.0,August,2023,negative,Cleanses but you can have a feel that consistency is an issue and you can feel granular consistency after brush. No soapy foambrings somewhat less psychological aspect of not a good clean up.
2.0,January,2024,neutral,No need to waste money on this
3.0,August,2021,positive,"The toothpaste is good. Quite good tha. The commercial ones we get in the market. But this is the second time I am experiencing same problem. The nozzle of the toothpaste leaks from the side. By the time the toothpaste is half, the nozzle neck almost tears out. It means packaging of toothpaste is faulty. If this can be rectified, it would be good."
3.0,March,2021,negative,"Pls ses the pic and you will realise how poor is the manufacturing of tube. The seam is cracked and paste comes out of that place. This has happened for the 2nd time. 1st time i had complained yo the company of 2 paste with similar cracks. They replaced it, but the replacement again shows the crack. So there is an inherent problem with quality of tube manufacturing."
2.0,June,2023,positive,
2.0,April,2023,negative,Not good very bad product
1.0,August,2023,positive,Good taste but cause instant bleeding due large abrasive particles - worse than road side dant manjan powders
3.0,October,2021,negative,Teeth and mouth does not feel fresh after brushing and does not seem good for tooth enamel as well
3.0,January,2019,negative,The proct was gud. Bt my baby not like the taste of this paste.and this tooth paste is not forming form.the chemical for making foam is absent in this paste. The smell of this tooth paste is really ayurvedic like ayurvedic tooth powder. Not bad. Bt  some chidrns not like the flvr of this
3.0,July,2021,positive,Seems like good organic stuff but I think the salt makes your mouth smell after a while
3.0,May,2021,negative,Tooth paste worth paying but the tube is made poorly so the tip gets broken and leaves it open.
2.0,November,2021,positive,"It includes all good ingredients and it ha sno chemicals. But after 20 days of use, the quality of the plastic went out and there was some holes in the plastic. And the toothpaste was becoming harder to bring it out."
1.0,May,2018,neutral,"It is a grey colored paste since it contains clay. It is sweet in taste, nothing weird. But a sudden switch from a foaming toothpaste to a non-foaming one will be difficult, because more product will be needed to get that clean-teeth feel. And if you already suffer from dental conditions please stay away from this one because it made my gum inflammation worse. Or atleast check with your dentist before using this product. Oral health is really important because if you cannot eat properly, then it will affect your overall health. So, don't risk your well-being. Besides even this a chemical product and no full ingredient list is present. I do not recommend this paste for dental sufferers. I felt instead of going for chemicals, lets use ayurvedic tooth powders which are safe and economical and really strengthens the teeth and gums when used regularly. Hope this helps."
3.0,October,2018,negative,The manufacturer name on the paste  is indian dental organisation not indian medical association (IDA) so better understand the difference I am not sure of the contains present in the paste and the sincerity of the productsThe paste I Abit salty

3.0,August,2018,neutral,Nothing special about it.  I couldn't find any noticeable change after using it for 3 weeks.
1.0,October,2018,positive,"Fluoride free is a marketing hoax. Period. I started using this toothpaste for 2 days & noticed stench on my breath along with a mild tooth ache. Fluoride is important for your teeth as it removes gems & other harmful bacteria in your mouth. Without it you're risking your dental health. There aren't enough research papers to prove fluoride free is safe & healthy for your teeth. Fluoride is dangerous only when your tap water contains above normal fluoride levels, so for most of us there isn't any requirement to go fluoride free."
3.0,September,2019,negative,Packaging was very bad but the toothpaste is very nice
2.0,May,2021,negative,It is natural chemical free but not effective on teeth. Cant able to remove bed smell. Plus expensive also. Not recommended

3.0,March,2019,negative,Totally natural but its very hard and feels very raw
1.0,March,2019,negative,"Waste Waste Waste !!! of money never buy it, I purchase it under the influence of chemical free but it does not have other substance that is Nowadays used in Sulphate free toothpaste they are just selling a cheap clay Calcium Bentonite with a fancy label it in gel form. My teeth a bit get dull yellow after one month of use taste is worse. Don't even worth a try."
3.0,September,2019,neutral,No flavour
1.0,January,2019,negative,"I am using it nearly 6 months. Recently I went to a dentist for a treatment of my father. I told him about this toothpaste and ""indian dental organization"". He replied that he was an active member of ""indian dental Association"" and he don't know about ""indian dental organization"".It may be a private organization and this product is not reliable."
1.0,September,2019,negative,"I gave this toothpaste a fair shot. But I can't appreciate its taste or the feeling I get after using this. Also, some of my gums started to bleed when I switched to this ""toothpaste"".I have thrown the rest in trash after using for 10 days. Also, who is this ""Indian Dental Organization""??"
1.0,April,2021,positive,The content is clay which is ok but it is something which doesn‚Äôt flow freely from the tube which is gross & the seal was too tough & unnecessary

1.0,February,2021,negative,Come very brittle and dry. Started foaming once you realise to brush it well. Scam product pretending to be SLS free.
,on,16,negative,This does not come out easy and if you squeeze it to where it comes out it puffs out a big gust of air and it all flies out all over the place.
