3.0,February,2023,positive,Received the package. All good but i dont like the taste.Taste is little bit different from those I have used it before. Is it a duplicate product? I m curious.

3.0,June,2022,negative,"I purchased this Colgate toothpaste in January to use it over a period of 6 months or so. This special deal comes with 4 individually packed toothpaste tubes. The first 3 packets I used over a period of 4 to 5 months were fine. However, the toothpaste tube in the last packet I opened after about 5 months was damaged. By this time the return period was over. Hence, I do not have any option other that writing this review. I have purchased such deals in the past. However, this is the first time I had this issue. So my rating is only for this consignment."

2.0,May,2023,negative,"The product Colgate tooth paste is, as expected, good quality. However, to my surprise Amazon charged me Rs 342 for a product which has Rs 325 marked as MRP. This is a wrong practice, charging a consumer more than a price marked as MRP. Please refer to the attached photograph."
