2.0,February,2024,positive,I feel it has artificial flavours compared with lever ayush clove oil paste. It has artificial clove flavour and Menthol to give freshness feeling.
1.0,February,2024,positive,Big and full of clove pics gives impression that it's very herbal and safe. Just check the side effect of few chemical in it. 1-sodium lauryl sulphate 2-sodium saccharin & sodium silicate 3-sodium benzoate 4- benzyl alcohol . Most of the chemical used in detergent have been used.
