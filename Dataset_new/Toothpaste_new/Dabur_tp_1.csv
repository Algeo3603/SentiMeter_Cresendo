1.0,December,2019,negative,I have been using Dabur Red toothpaste for past three years. The toothpaste is very good and effective for dental problems. However the product I bought online from Amazon in December 2019 is substandard. It has no quality as that of local store and the flavor is very bitter. The toothpaste is appearing as if it is diluted with water. It is foaming more than the original toothpaste that we get in local store.The batches product sold online in Amazon are available at a discounted price but quality and flavor is very poor. It seems that these batches are factory rejected items.Please do not buy from Amazon. Instead buy it from local store.

1.0,July,2023,negative,The pack said to contain 4 tubes of 200 gms paste but contained only 3 tubes of 200 gms. Paste.Supplying only 690 gms toothpaste against supposed 800 gms was highly disappointing. Feeling cheated.

1.0,March,2021,negative,"See where it is fit to be thrown!It burns the mouth seriously and creates further complications of sores too!Some reviews mentioned the burning and hence not using itSome liking it because of its burning sensationSome bearing with the burning for the first two to three months,then finding it favourite of long time,However you may choose to deal with the burning, it definitely burns and spoils the mood for the whole day and creates concern about mouth sores for a few days later, just after one use!Dabur's online report somewhere claims that everyone doesn't have the same physiology and hence toothpastes can feel differently to different people and may be even have allergic reactions to some!Well, toothpastes must suit all physiologies and if they don't, they are a health hazard and not fit to be brought to the market!The minimum legal requirement is a prominent warning about it becoming a hazard to certain types on the ads, product description and the package!In the absence of the above, see where it is fit to be thrown in!"
