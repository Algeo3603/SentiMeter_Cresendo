3.0,July,2023,negative,"I have used Dabur Red Gel it for over 4 weeks now. I have found that It does not help in removing Tarter or reducing tooth cavity. It only provides for a fresh breath (At least in my case).I appriciated the taste of it however using for prolonged periods like 5-6 minutes will lead to a strong burning & stinging sensation in the mouth and inner Lip area.If you are looking for a toothpaste to fight tooth cavity and tarter buildup on gums, this toothpaste WILL NOT do the job.If you are looking for a herbal alternative for healthy teeth, instead try Himalaya Complete Care Toothpaste or Patanjali Dantkanti Advance."
