3.0,May,2021,negative,"Personal experience - my mouth felt fresh for 2 - 3 hours of using them and the scent also vanished by that time. I didn't see any increased ""whiteness"" in my teeth as this supposed to be Sparkling White toothpaste."
3.0,September,2022,positive,It is good
3.0,August,2020,negative,I got this seeing the name sparkling white. Have been using this since alomst 3 months and I have not seen any difference.I would prefer to go back to herbal paste and they taste good and thy have many condiments blended into it.Unless you wish to try you could buy it. Although it does not appeal to me.

1.0,September,2020,negative,"Worst experience. After couple of brushes developed sensitivity which only got rectified after I changed the paste. Everyone in the family developed tooth issue after using the paste. Never had any issue with teeth before using this paste, thankfully, it got sorted after I changed the paste.Himalaya has stooped to a new low in quality. Avoid at all cost. Never in my life I am going to buy Himalaya paste again.Now I'm stuck with a one full tube and one partially used. Bogus product."

3.0,September,2019,neutral,Normal.
2.0,June,2017,negative,This toothpaste is not that good. It doesn't provide freshness after brushing because it doesn't contain mint or any type of coolness providing substance. You won't feel fresh and cooling sensation in your mouth and throat after you brush your teeth from this toothpaste. Instead buy Pantanjali DantKanti. It is far more better than it.
