2.0,September,2023,negative,"Dabur's Maswak paste is ayurvedic by the way and it is good to use but its taste is not good due to which not everyone likes its test so use it.  Few people do. I also ordered the toothpaste from amazon in my house, but due to its taste not good and due to a couple of shortcomings, our family members have stopped using it.  And they are saying that our teeth are damaged, our gums are damaged, but I like it, but I don't like the taste, so I don't think it's very good, so I give this page and two stars."

2.0,July,2023,negative,Not ok tastes like mint but in bad way
1.0,October,2023,negative,"Product packing was bad and damaged. Oil spill on the packing and even seeped into the product. Also, product manufacturing date is old.On the whole looks like a repacked product"
3.0,June,2021,neutral,Flavor and freshness are not the main reasons for buying a toothpaste. It needs to be good at cleaning teeth. This paste is poorer than regular white toothpastes from good brands at removing plaque or food biofilm sticking on teeth despite producing enough foam. I think the manufacturers haven't got the combination of abrasives and foaming agents right. And the the paste contains some preservatives like sodium benzoate that are not present in many non-herbal toothpastes
3.0,April,2022,negative,The taste remains in the tongue for a very long time which is a downside for me as it makes the other flavour of the food not enjoyable.
1.0,September,2023,negative,I ordered the dabur meshwak paste every time it used to come properly but his time instead of 2 I just received one and the box was separate and the tooth paste seperate
1.0,July,2023,positive,"The only thing good about this toothpaste is its flavour. Now, the main part, the company is using cheap plastic fillings which is HARMFUL to our health in the toothpaste in the form of PVM/MA Copolymer which is a NANOPLASTICS and plastics can cause deadly diseases. Avoid this toothpaste at all costs and know which brand gives you a genuinely good toothpaste and which brands don't care about your health but only your money."
1.0,September,2023,negative,"Date sirf 1month ka tha, or production bhi bilkul ghatiya hai.... Plz don't buy this"

1.0,May,2023,negative,"This is one of the worst toothpaste that I've ever used- It makes your mouth extremely dry which can cause other issues- in my case, that extreme dryness lead to throat pain for weeks- the taste lingers in your mouth for like the entire day. You won't be able to enjoy the taste of food during that timeI would rather stick to my modern day toothpaste instead of this"
