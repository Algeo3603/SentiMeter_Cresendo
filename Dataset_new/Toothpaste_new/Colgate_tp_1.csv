3.0,January,2024,positive,Good
2.0,January,2024,negative,"I've used it and got little results. Could be used for a month but don't use it regularly (my dentist also recommended the same) as it would decay your enamle. If your teeths are very yellow then go for some Desi jugads (home made remidies) or consult your dentist. It won't fully brighten your teeth but would give some result. Overall, could be used for a month or less but do not even think of using it regularly :)"
3.0,October,2023,positive,Good
3.0,September,2023,neutral,It's a normal toothpaste. Nothing Wow  about it. It does nothing just cleaning. If you are buying to make your teeth white don't go for it.
3.0,July,2023,positive,Ok
3.0,February,2023,negative,"Unexpected, I am on last I mean third almost getting over I brush my teeth 3 times a Day , not at all effective on my yellow stain , if U r looking for Whitening its complete fake its just normal toothpaste"

2.0,September,2023,neutral,Your teeth will never become white if you use this paste
2.0,September,2023,negative,Not very good just value of money
2.0,June,2023,negative,It is peeling my skin on my lips If I use it twice a day. The product mentioned to use 3 times a day but when I used it my lips became completely chapped and It took me till a week to recover my lips.
1.0,October,2023,negative,"I am trying all Indian brands of toothpaste until I can settle on one I like. This one leaves my teeth feeling gritty after a few days. It doesn‚Äôt compare well with the foreign brands I usually use. But taste is better than others. The toothpaste is semi liquid, and hardly stay on the toothbrush. Also a problem with Indian toothpastes."
3.0,September,2022,positive,"Whitening capabilities are just a sham, I am doing this review after 6 months of usage. Nope, your teeth won't turn white as they say. But it gives great freshness, so I am fine with that."
3.0,February,2022,neutral,"After using this for a month I can say this somewhat helps Making the teeths white. But not as bright as I expected and shown on packaging. Also the taste is very weird, but you'll get used to once you start using it.I would prefer a regular toothpaste from next time."
3.0,July,2022,negative,Packaging was not good for this product . Kindly make the product value for money and donot send a defected product to us .thnks
3.0,June,2022,neutral,As I drink so much coffee we all know what happens.  This product works only a little but doesn't whiten too much
3.0,September,2022,neutral,Freshness is there but no whiteness
3.0,September,2020,neutral,Been using this for 2 months now and I don't see any results. I've been avoiding foods that stain teeth but still I don't see much results. Giving it three stars as it leaves a fresh feeling in my mouth otherwise it's just a waste of time and effort if you wanna use it for whitening purposes.
1.0,September,2023,negative,Not worthit it does't white your teeth totally worst . It just like normal toothpaste
3.0,July,2022,positive,Supper

3.0,November,2021,neutral,Gutka ke dag nikalne me success nahi raha
3.0,August,2014,negative,"Brushing with this paste 3 times a day seems to make your teeth a bit sensitive, so I also ended up having to brush once a day with a sensitive relief paste, and seemed crazy to be brushing 4 times a day!The minty taste lingers in your mouth for a couple of minutes, although the freshness not for all that long. Should go for a mouth wash after too.While my teeth seem better, I do not believe they are 1 shade whiter, but I did miss the afternoon brush on a couple of occasions. Going to continue on this paste with 3x brushing for the month. Will update the review if anything changes."
3.0,January,2022,positive,Good product
3.0,January,2021,neutral,Nothing much happens to your teeth as claimed in terms of whiteness u can use other product in lesser price range

1.0,August,2023,negative,So bad tooth paste.
1.0,August,2023,positive,
1.0,September,2022,negative,"This is just false advertisement. It wont do anything special but clean your teeth like a regular toothpaste. Whitening? hell no. In fact my teeth started to turn yellow. Could be due to the excess of fluoride it contains. whatever. I wont buy it again. It belongs to the fairness cream category, just fancy branding."
3.0,September,2018,neutral,It's an ordinary toothpaste. Keeps your teeth clean if brush regularly just like any other toothpaste. Doesn't make your teeth 'one shade whiter' as the company claims.Bought the 200 gm. pack only because I got it in the lightning deal @ Rs. 79.
3.0,October,2015,negative,Don't believe that you will see changes in a week as advertised.I have been using this product for 3 months and I have seen some visible change in the color of my teeth. I drink lots of Tea so this toothpaste helped me to regain some whiteness which I lost.. Even though the price is higher its worth to spend. But believe me its a slow process and you wont find any difference if u check everyday.may a couple of months will make a differnce worth noticeable
