3.0,February,2024,negative,"Have been using this paste for sometime now and really liked it. But gradually they are reducing quantity and there is more of air. Have again ordered today 9.2.24, if I find the same again, this may be my last order and will switch to some other product"
1.0,January,2024,negative,"It is Really Waste Product, It doesn't Feel Like I brush my Teeth after Brushing.Trust me guys,Plz don't waste money"
1.0,January,2024,negative,"I was disappointed to find a feather in my toothpaste today. This unexpected and unhygienic discovery has shaken my confidence in the product's quality. Such incidents are unacceptable, and I urge the manufacturer to ensure better quality control."
1.0,January,2024,negative,Using cardamom one and is worst m telling u..
3.0,February,2023,positive,When I used first tube ( fresh breath and my kid liked it) was very good. I purchased the next combo pack( totally changed taste which my kid isn't accepting) which isn't good.
3.0,November,2021,positive,"I like it how it doesn't produce any foam and the freshness is very good but i bought a combo pack having 2 tubes! I found the first one i used very good but in the latter, i found that sometimes i couldn't even brush with even with small amount of paste would burn my mouth! Since i have worked in a pharma company i know where it went in manufacturing! Quality and production team should focus more on giving good product!"
3.0,March,2023,positive,LOOK LIKE THE OLD STOCK POCKET WAS FULLY WRAPPED
2.0,July,2023,negative,"No foam, no feeling of brushing. Ilachi concentration is more, overall not good"
3.0,December,2022,positive,It has Natural ingredient.It will not create foam.Taste is Ok.Pricewise costly.
1.0,November,2023,positive,Flavour is good but I got mouth ulcer after using it
2.0,March,2023,positive,Flavour is good and freshens mouth but after one week of use MOUTH ULCERS developed. Stopped using and switched to my old toothpaste. Youtube videos are mostly paid reviews .
3.0,March,2022,neutral,On actual product there is green line which indicates natural ingredients and not black as per photo..however long is not there which is main ingredient for dental health.
3.0,January,2022,positive,"This toothpaste is best to use for a change. Strong elaichi flavour and no foaming. Cleaning value is average. Instead better to go for Vicco, Sudanta or Dant Kanti"
1.0,February,2023,negative,"After watching YouTube videos on which is good ayurvedic toothpaste to used, I decided to try this cardamom flavoured toothpaste.. but utterly disappointedâ€¦1) itâ€™s very sweet like pistachios ice cream2) donâ€™t think it is ayurvedic medicine and will help oral health in long run as it has too much of sugar3) it is expensive4) never felt that I have cleaned my mouth5) I think sellers knows that customer will not buy again hence they are selling two pieces; no option to buy one piece"
1.0,October,2023,negative,Quality Is Poor I am Not Interested
3.0,December,2021,positive,Favour and freshness is very goodNot able to provide whitness to teeth.Pricy.foam free.
2.0,March,2023,positive,Ok ok
2.0,September,2020,positive,"Not only is this toothpaste fluoride free, it is binder free. (A binder in toothpaste is used to stabilize toothpaste formula to prevent separation of the liquid and solid components.) The paste disintegrates to a powder on the application of water, and falls from the brush before it does what it is supposed to do, abrade plaque. The taste of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) overrides the flavour of cardamom, leaving an unpleasant taste during use. So it's back to Dant Kanti for me."
3.0,March,2021,positive,"Nice cardamom taste and light smell. But, as it is foamless so, need to use more than any foam based toothpaste."
3.0,March,2021,negative,It's not worth it compare to so much tough market . Make check toothpaste softness and hardness before packing
1.0,May,2022,negative,"Initially I loved the toothpaste. I loved the taste of cardamom flavor and enjoyed brushing twice a day with this.After about one month suddenly I discovered stain dots in mirror. On looking the inside, I was shocked. Several of my teeth is stained.I have never had this problem and I have always maintained good oral hygiene.Clearly this toothpaste is causing the stain."
1.0,March,2023,negative,"This toothpaste does nothing it gives you gum, pain and tooth pain. So severe that I was not able to chew my food very bad experience with this toothpaste please donâ€™t waste your money on this."
2.0,June,2022,negative,Not useful in solving any tooth or  gum problems. Even normal toothpastes are better than this
2.0,September,2019,neutral,"Totally no foam. I gone with the claim of no fluoride, paraben, SLS etc. If there is no foam generated, you cannot have a proper brushing. How much quantity you apply, it does not generate foam and you finish your brushing in just 1 minute. Your dress will get spoiled for sure while brushing. Taste is equal to soil if you ever tasted soil. Totally useless paste for this price. Don't get fooled by 4 star rating."
2.0,September,2021,negative,Packaging is very poor. Attaching image for reference. I have used only 10% . Now as I canâ€™t close tube properly. So no use of 90% remaining past.
1.0,August,2022,negative,"I purchased it after seeing the ingredients and all, but when I used it I got buccal mucosal ulcers. Intially 2 times I thought it could be due to something else, but I got the ulcers after re-challenging it for the 2nd time as well."
3.0,September,2019,negative,It's not suitable for me. The lumpy lumpy it has is the main problem.Its better when I use by mixing it with colgate.

3.0,August,2021,positive,"The toothpaste is really great but the packaging/tube for it is awful.Since the paste is less smooth/'liquidy' than most toothpastes, it gets too dried and hence the tube breaks/cuts from the top. Have bought 5+ tubes and all of them got the cut mid way of their usage.I hope the company reads these reviews and improve their tube quality soon."
