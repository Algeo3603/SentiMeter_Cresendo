1.0,February,2024,negative,Don't buy this product this is not Appu the mark the tube has lots of water due to which it is very thin as a result you have to waste your money. I recommend Dabur and Patanjali toothpaste  which is better than this in every respect.

1.0,December,2017,negative,"Switching over to this product was one of the bad decisions I took for my teeth. Within a week, my milk teeth started turning yellow. I wanted to try an Indian brand and this was the result.

1.0,September,2020,negative,"Worst experience. After couple of brushes developed sensitivity which only got rectified after I changed the paste. Everyone in the family developed tooth issue after using the paste. Never had any issue with teeth before using this paste, thankfully, it got sorted after I changed the paste.Himalaya has stooped to a new low in quality. Avoid at all cost. Never in my life I am going to buy Himalaya paste again.Now I'm stuck with a one full tube and one partially used. Bogus product."

3.0,September,2019,neutral,Normal.
2.0,June,2017,negative,This toothpaste is not that good. It doesn't provide freshness after brushing because it doesn't contain mint or any type of coolness providing substance. You won't feel fresh and cooling sensation in your mouth and throat after you brush your teeth from this toothpaste. Instead buy Pantanjali DantKanti. It is far more better than it.
1.0,May,2020,negative,Wrong product delivered and now you say it is not eligible for replace or refund. Have asked for only sparkling white tooth paste without any additional flavor. Product delivered is papaya & pineapple enzymes.

,October,2022,positive,"Ingredients au top, bonne note sur yukaPar contre trop de mousse=> pourquoi autant sachant que les dentifrices bio n’en font pas justement ?Goût hyper fort.Pas de label pour les « ingrédients organiques ».Produit en Inde => attention à l’empreinte carbon de cet article.Il faut mettre seulement une trace de dentifrice sur sa brosse afin de ne pas été gêné par la mousse et le goût fort.Finalement je ne recommande pas vraiment car on trouve meilleurs ailleurs (Lavera, Logona) avec des logos bio et produites en Europe."
,October,2023,neutral,"No está mal, pero tampoco me encanta"
,July,2019,positive,"Mich stört, dass die Zahncreme beim Auftragen auf die Zahnbürste jedes Mal klebrige Fäden zieht. Ansonsten ist der Geschmack aber toll, sehr natürlich, sehr zimtig und frisch!"
,October,2020,positive,"Molto buono e salutare ma il sapore, ahimè, stucchevole. Io preferisco altri similari a questo prodotto ma è del tutto soggettivo. Per esempio il mio ragazzo lo preferisce a quello che utilizziamo di solito (sempre ayurvedico). Comunque per chi volesse uscire dai prodotti commerciali, può essere una scelta ma attenzione: il rapporto qualità prezzo non è dei migliori"
,February,2024,negative,"I like this toothpaste I have the mint flavor so I thought oh I'll buy the cinnamon flavor. Well that didn't go so well with my body. I end up having a reaction to it .my tongue swelled up my throat was closing I had to take a Benadryl right away and go to the hospital. To me I don't like any flavors to my toothpaste, I just like a plain toothpaste.I hope this company reads this and make one without any flavor. Cuz people have allergies and it could be life-threatening just like me. I'm not allergic to cinnamon but I was allergic to this kind in this toothpaste that almost cost me my life. I hope this company. can make one that I can buy all the time that has no flavor to it. We really don't need flavor in our toothpaste. We don't need scented bounce we don't need scented dish detergent. It's really bad for our health."
,on,5,negative,"I chose the Cinnamon flavor as I dislike the peppermint flavor, however the menthol flavor from the peppermint leaves in the ingredients over powers the cinnamon flavor. Peppermint is a cultivar of Spearmint. Spearmint leaves contain less menthol which if they had been used would have improved the cinnamon flavor. Its hard to find a tooth paste without to much menthol, and is fluoride free. Fluoride is the second most dangerous metal for your body. Please do your own research on Fluoride to understand the dangers of this metal. Anything placed in your mouth is still absorbed into your body. Now I need to keep looking for a better tooth paste flavor. If the flavor was right this tooth paste would have been perfect."
,on,6,positive,"This toothpaste has a kick. My preferred flavor is cinnamon but it’s difficult finding a natural toothpaste in cinnamon so I was thrilled to find this one. I have been a Hello brand user for years and have been content with that as it’s kept my teeth healthy but wanted to try something new, so here I am. The only thing I don’t like about this toothpaste is the lid. Why doesn’t it have the ease of a flip top lid? Hopefully this will be fixed in the future.Update:After finishing my first and only tube of this toothpaste apparently I’m a HELLO brand loyalist. Hello just does a better job cleaning. My mouth feels cleaner longer and my breath stays fresher longer. I wish Hello made different flavor options like this brand but I’ll take clean over flavor any day."
,on,25,positive,"Taste was ok, I like that it is natural, but did not like the after taste, breath feel."
,on,12,negative,"Annoyingly, this toothpaste has severely inflamed my gums, tongue and the entire lining of my mouth, after only 5 days of using it.First time around I didn't think the issue came from this toothpaste, however I intuitively stopped using it because of the strong cinnamon flavor was badly hurting all parts of the inside of my inflamed mouth.It took around 3 long weeks for the inflammation to heal, during which time it was really painful to eat, drink, and to clean my teeth.A couple of months later I spotted the toothpaste again in my cupboard and started to use it for the second time. This is when I actually realized that the previous massive mouth-lining-inflammation was caused by this specific cinnamon flavored toothpaste, as the lining of my mouth, gums and tongue started to hurt severely again, after only 3-4 days of using it, this time around.I never have problems with cinnamon otherwise, I often get a cinnamon roll, put fresh cinnamon in my porridge, or drink cinnamon tea, which never gives me any reactions of any kind.So something is not quite right or balanced with this toothpaste.Has anybody experienced anything similar at all?"
,on,18,negative,"I found this to be too runny in consistency - basically falling off the toothbrush before it could be utilized. ""Simply Cinnamon"" flavor was a huge disappointment as it tasted more like strong, slightly bitter spearmint."
,on,26,negative,"I love cinnamon, but this is probably the worst tasting toothpaste I have ever used. That is saying a lot for someone who doesn't like mint. I just got this today and only used it once. It tasted like the spices they sometimes put with cinnamon for fragrance. Had I known this, I never would have bought it. $7 down the tubes - literally! ?? I'm hoping this message saves someone with similar taste buds from wasting their money."
,on,29,negative,Unfortunately I missed that this contains neem oil. It ruins the taste and feels like brushing with mouth wash.
,April,2023,positive,"Haven’t used this long enough to judge its efficacy, but on day one I noticed the flavor was off. Tastes like there might be fennel and mint as well as cinnamon. Not terrible, but a little offputting."
,on,30,positive,"I was so very excited to get this cinnamon flavoured toothpaste. Put it on my brush, smelled not so much like cinnamon, started brushing. So very disappointed.  Flavour is more clove then cinnamon.  Nasty like an old ham or 1960/ 70s dental office."
,on,16,negative,"If you are looking for cinnamon toothpaste, this is not it. No cinnamon listed in ingredients, while midway through the list is menthol- when I was specifically looking for non-mint toothpaste as it irritates my gums. I decided to try it anyways because I was out of toothpaste and the taste, while probably less minty than other toothpastes, was definitely not cinnamon. I hope my favorite toothpaste comes back in stock soon."
,on,25,positive,In general it's probably a good toothpaste although a bit minty not the cinnamon flavor I was expecting and hoping for. However I didn't buy it for me I bought it for my special needs son who cannot tolerate the minty flavor. I don't really care for the flavor either but it's non refundable unfortunately so I guess I'll use it until it's gone. Have to go back to our previous toothpaste and see if it's back in stock
,on,19,positive,"I would give it 0 ??.If you don’t need your tongue use this tooth paste.I was searching for a sls free and natural tooth paste. The only positive thing about this item is the great smell of it (cinnamon smell) before you use it.It is almost impossible for me to use it, it numbs my mouth and tongue for hours. Waste of money and probably health."
,on,6,negative,"As others have written, the toothpaste simply has no cinnamon taste.  I love cinnamon and was looking for an alternative for Tom's Cinnamon toothepaste.  I can get other flavors of Tom's locally at my stores, but for some reason cinnamon is not available.  Buying it on Amazon, the cinnamon flavor is twice as expensive as the ones I can buy in store and I hate paying double for something just for the taste.  So I was searching for a suitable Tom's cinnamon replacement.  This is a very good toothepaste, but if you're purchasing because you're looking for a cinnamon flavor, as I was, I suggest keep looking.  I've tried two different alternatives and both have failed.  Guess I'll be ordering some Tom's off Amazon once I'm finished with this tube."
,on,12,positive,My kids use the mint flavor that they seem to enjoy. I typically get the Nano Cinnamon brand but they are out of stock. This tastes NOTHING like cinnamon. It has a very strong minty menthol taste. As well as a horrible aftertaste (much like diet soda or sweet n low) I used once. This item is not eligible for return or refund.
,March,2023,negative,"Compré este dentífrico para un familiar.Lo usó durante un tiempo hasta que tuvo que acudir al dentista por la aparición de lesiones en la boca (y ¡hasta en la comisura de los labios!).Y parece que todas esas lesiones (estomatitis de contacto y papilitis) fueron causadas por esta pasta de dientes. Por recomendación facultativa dejó de usarla una semana y ¡santo remedio! comenzaron a desaparecer.Tras analizar sus ingredientes parece que utiliza limpiadores formadores de espuma muy potentes (de hecho mi familiar se sorprendía por la cantidad impresionante de espuma que hacía) que resecan la mucosa y la hacen propicia a infecciones e irritaciones.Me he animado a escribir esta reseña por si esta experiencia, que ¡ojo! es solamente eso, una experiencia personal, puede resultar de ayuda a otrxs compradorxs. Es posible que esta pasta de dientes no les afecte, pero si sus encías, lengua, dientes o boca son sensibles quizás deberían plantearse otra opción."
,October,2021,positive,"If you are like me and was trying to avoid mint, be warned this does contain mint! Other than that the flavor is good and my wife likes it! I believe it should be more clear, you think by buying cinnamon, you're buying a toothpaste for people with issues with mint and yet mint is included...."
,on,30,negative,"I have no experience with this toothpaste to describe its effectiveness, because the intolerable taste made me stop using it immediately. Its strong cinnamon flavor does not mask the strange strong chemical taste. Buyers should also note that the product is not eligible for a return for a refund: you try new buy it."
,on,11,negative,"Sorry. I have issues with peppermint so was really looking forward to this. It tastes horrible, medicinally, just a horrid taste. Would love to return, just not allowed. Very disappointed. Save your money."
,January,2023,negative,"I am unable to have mint toothpaste, so I’ve been looking for a good replacement. I’ve tried several different brands that were OK but not great so I kept looking. Himalaya complete care toothpaste is the worst tasting toothpaste I have ever had. It tastes a bit like dirt and the texture is not much better. I tried to return it for a refund, but Amazon doesn’t do refunds for this product!. So if you haven’t tried it before, and want to give it a try, buy it somewhere like Walmart that accepts refunds for everything. A better cinnamon toothpaste, believe it or not, is Close-Up. Unfortunately, it has fluoride which I would prefer not to have, but at least it taste better, foams well, and leaves you with fresh breath"
,on,2,negative,I only selected this item because the photo shows two pieces.Only one item… bait and switch.
,on,6,negative,"My teeth were clean, and the taste wasn’t too spicy, but it sure did burn… wasn’t sure what it was at first but I began to feel my inside mouth more…felt off… then i thought i had cuts on my lower inner lip… nope, my inner lip was just feeling sensitive because it had been exposed to too much cinnamon essential oil or something else in the the toothpaste. Not worth the daily discomfort. Not going to use it anymore!"
,on,3,negative,"I initially liked this toothpaste because the flavour was so much better than the nuclear mint I'd been battling for years, but within a day of using this, the corners of my mouth started to get dry and developed micro cuts in the skin. After two days, my mouth was sore and dry and my lips had got worse. Three days in and my mouth, tongue and lips are stinging, sore, red and swollen. I've decided to stop using it and try something else before it gets any worse. I feel like I've got a sandpaper rough, dry as a desert, bee sting trout pout.The toothpaste is incredibly foamy - worse than regular toothpaste and unfortunately it made me gag quite a bit. I also think this is why my lips got so dry, as it was like spitting out shaving foam by the end! I like the fact that it wasn't grainy like some toothpastes, but that and the flavour were the only plus points for me. It was very expensive - about 4 times the price of my regular toothpaste. Sadly a waste of money that I can't pass on to anyone else, given the hygiene issue with that."
,on,19,positive,"I had high hopes for this toothpaste, I really did! Cinnamon happens to be one of my all time favorite flavors. I use it in so many things. Unfortunately, this toothpaste tastes like cinnamon and some sort of mint may have been passing through an adjacent space to where this was made. There is something else you need to beware of...I worked with a dentist who had been to the USSR back in the '80s. He brought back a souvenir toothpaste from Moscow. The first week he let me try a little. It tasted like getting shampoo in your mouth on accident while rinsing your hair. It was unpleasant and required many rinses and brushing with good ole ""made in the USA"" toothpaste to rid my mouth of the flavor medley.I wish this toothpaste had been as benign as the Russian paste was! Instead, everytime I've attempted to brush, I feel like I'm being punished for the F - - - word. Yes, the granddaddy of them all. I have no proof, but it's possible Lifebuoy and Palmolive collaborated on the perfect parent hack to curb that particular word and I was just the guinea pig to try it out on. Hey, I willingly tried Russian toothpaste at one point in my life...Pros: perfect for teaching lessons to the littles about the importance of not using those swear wordsCons: may cause blindness from soap poisoningWould I buy it or recommend it? Yes, if curbing swearing is the goal. I think it would also make a swell White Elephant gift."
,on,20,positive,"I can not honestly write about effectiveness because the only way to know is over time.  I had hoped for a better brushing experience in regard to flavor and feel.  While it gives one the sense that it is probably doing a good job, the overall personal satisfaction after the fact is just not there for me."
,on,29,positive,"I look for any toothpaste other than mint, so this was intriguing. It is expensive, and I would say it is a high quality product and a good size, so for a product that is not 'mass market' it is reasonable. The taste has something else in there that I cannot pin down - it has undertones of clove (and I do not like cloves) but that is not listed in the ingredients."
,on,28,positive,"I really enjoy a cinnamon tasting toothpaste. Unfortunately, this taste like couch syrup, a very medicine taste, all I said was yuk. Cleans good though like a regular toothpaste, but I chose this product because of the cinnamon taste."
,on,7,neutral,"It cleans my teeth fine, but I don't care for the taste and I usually love anything cinnamon."
,on,27,positive,It has mint in it. But the cinnamon flavor is nice. Doesn't really foam up.
,on,12,negative,It burns mouth a little.  Can't use minty toothpaste because of the burning sensation.  Surprised this also burns my mouth.
,March,2023,negative,"Das in dieser Zahnpasta enthaltene Zimtöl hat bei mir eine starke allergische Reaktionen an meinen Lippen und im Mund ausgelöst, so das die Oberlippe stark angeschwollen ist. Nach dem Absetzen ging die Schwellung wieder vollständig zurück. An der Qualität der Zahnpasta ist nichts auszusetzen."
,on,11,negative,The taste is terrible ??
,on,6,negative,"Amazing texture and flavour and my mouth felt very clean after. However, even though am not allergic to anything my mouth got blisters with in a few days and 5 days after constant use I have small blisters on my lips and they are swollen. I haven't used the toothpaste today and whent back to sandard toothpaste and my mouth is already calming down, my lips is getting back to normal size and I can start eating normally again. If you do have an allergy for anything on the ingridiets list or if your mouth and lips gets blisters after use it may be due to this toothpaste. If not, I do highly recommend it as it taste amazing and you feel clean!"
,May,2021,neutral,I like the taste but didn't like that my teeth didn't feel as clean with it.
,on,28,negative,"The first time I brushed my teeth I kept getting these whiffs of compost-fertilizer mixed in with the cinnamon flavor.I finally figured it out when I smelled the box. The brand name box which holds the toothpaste boasts of being ""green"" by it's recycled look and brown liner.... unfortunately it smells recycled in a way that includes something that reminds me of fertilizer (slightly manure-ish)... and this strong, unpleasant smell permeated the toothpaste itself (unfortunately).Maybe it's just the particular tube I got. Maybe it sat in a hot warehouse and the smell got baked in.The smell is subtle, not sharp, not unbearable, just noticeable enough that i try not to breath while I brush my teeth.I will finish the tube, but I won't be buying this again.It's a shame, because I get the sense that the cinnamon paste on it's own would seem pleasant.I believe it might just be the box that is imparting the unpleasant undertone."
,on,19,negative,This has to be the worst tasting toothpaste I have ever used. Awful chemical taste and the cinnamon taste in it is weak. I should have stayed with Coral toothpaste. I might add for anyone adventuresome to try it. If you squeeze the tube several times to mix it up it is tolerable. I am going to finish the tube and see if I can get used to it. Forgot to mention if you have not mixed it enough it will fry your mouth and gums
,on,7,positive,"Himalaya Botanique Complete Care Toothpaste, Simply Cinnamon, Plaque Reducer for Brighter Teeth and Fresh Breath, 5.29 ozI have trouble with mint/peppermint-flavored toothpaste.  It throws my mucous creation into overdrive for about a half hour.  I ordered this ""cinnamon""-flavored toothpaste.  The cost was good.  The flavor tastes awful, and it is mint and menthol based ... so ... mucous is back.  Very disappointing.  No negatives for the sellers.  They did their part very well with fast, accurate delivery and a good price."
,on,18,negative,I normally use Coral white cinnamon but it is out so I tried this. Uhhhgh AWFUL tasting and so hot I couldn't even make it 2 mins to brush my teeth bc my mouth was on fire. Cannot return so huge waste of $7. Tastes more like a hot peppermint. All reviews sd nice taste but DO NOT fall for that. It is not nice or cinnamon tasting. All it does is make your mouth burn and feel numb. Horrible. ZERO Stars!!
,August,2018,negative,"....which I personally like!?? But if you don't like cinnamon, don't buy this flavor.Cleans well, a bit watery but still an acceptable consistency.I'm a bit wary about this being manufactured in India but hopefully not a quality concern.OK but not sure if I'll buy this brand again."
,on,16,negative,where's the cinnamon?!  only a nasty overpowering menthol mint taste that just keeps getting worse!
,on,11,negative,Not good stuff.
,on,16,negative,"It is hard to discern any cinnamon taste really, I think there is a small amount of it but it more tastes like sarsaparilla tea to me instead and though I do not dislike sarsaparilla, I was wanting cinnamon."
,January,2022,negative,"I was looking for alternative flavors for a reason. Is it not clear that the product contains mint in it, which makes it unusable for me. Furthermore Due to Amazon's return policy I cant send it back even though I did not even open the box and I can smell the mint coming from it. Please make it clear so we don't waste our time and money."
,March,2023,positive,It’s mint and awful! Worst tasting toothpaste ever.
,on,8,negative,I just opened the box and the side of the toothpaste tube is split open.  The top is still sealed.  Can I send it back for a replacement?
,on,31,negative,I purchased this for my autistic family who vomit at the smell of mint. I'm glad I tried it first. There's no cinnamon flavor at all its about as minty as a dollar store collgate brand. Terrible waste of money.
,on,11,negative,"I went in really hoping to like this. Almost every alternative to the classic icky cinnamon toothpaste has been much better. This one is the only exception. It tastes horrible. Like really terrible. Pomagranate and cinnamon was a flavor combo I didn't think would work, but I thought this might've been a chance to prove me wrong. Turns out I was right the first time.I tried to get used to it and used it for another week and a half, but the taste was so appalling that I had to throw it out.The only reason this isn't getting one star is that it could be a personal preference issue, and it also did clean and whiten my teeth."
,March,2023,negative,"Très dispendieux, saveur très ordinaire et laisse un goût bizarre dans la bouche."
,on,3,negative,Doesn't seem to leave your mouth with a just brushed fresh feeling. Would not purchase again.
,on,15,positive,"They hype about this isn't that great. I do feel like it really does a good job cleaning my teeth, I thought the cinnamon taste would be more strong than it was, and it left a funky after taste in my mouth. With that being said, I didn't really feel as refreshed after brushing my teeth as I wanted to."
,on,18,negative,"I was hoping for a good strong Cinnamon Toothpaste, but sadly to say this is not it! For me it does not come across as a clean Cinnamon taste for me, but I will keep searching for a real Cinnamon tasting toothpaste that not has so much junk added to it."
,February,2022,negative,"Der Geschmack ist klasse, da ich Zimt liebe. Aber die Zahnpasta ist zu überteuert. Für 4 € würde ich Sie nochmals kaufen. Aber die Preisschwankung zwischen 8 bis 13 Euro ist schrecklich."
,January,2021,negative,"Trés déçue, j'ai commandé ce dentifrice supposément à la cannelle car je ne supporte pas le goût de la menthe et à la première utilisation le seul goût que l'on a (et qui reste longtemps dans la bouche) est la menthe.Trés trés trés déceuvant.  Qu'ils appellent ce dentifrice autrement!En plus, il contient du margousier (Neem) qui est un puissant perturbateur endocrinien, interdit dans certains pays!"
,on,5,negative,This toothpaste did not taste as I expected.  It did not taste much like cinnamon.  I didn't like the flavor.  I think the formula could be improved.  I won't buy this product again.  Not happy with it.; used half the tube and then tossed it.
,on,9,negative,This stuff is expensive foul tasting gooey Mint flavored toothpaste.  I HATE mint toothpaste so I ordred cinamon.  this stuff has NO cinnamon flavor  as it claims. but it does has menthol and it tastes like floor cleaner disinfectant. NASTY
,August,2022,negative,Very little cinnamon flavour not worth the high price.
,on,16,negative,"The product is named ""Simply Cinnamon"".  Cinnamon sticks are pictured on the box and tube.  The main color of the packaging is predominately cinnamon color.  YET, the product contains no cinnamon. In fact, this toothpaste has menthol from mint so it tastes like mint. Deceptive and false advertising at it's finest."
,on,9,negative,This is supposed to taste like cinnamon and it might have a faint cinnamon flavor but there is another flavor that is far stronger that I just do not like.  Luckily my spouse likes it so its not going to waste b/c i cant take it.
,on,18,negative,"Bontanique Simply Cinnamon. I""m very sensitive I don't know what's in the ingredients but something made the corners of my mouth and lips really sore, so had to stop using it. Passed it on to my husband he loves cinnamon to see how he gets on with it."
,on,13,negative,"This toothpaste did not taste like cinnamon.  It tastes like oregano and leaves a lingering taste in your mouth that is not good!  It also did not foam and my teeth did not feel clean, they were still gritty.  Would not recommend."
,on,21,negative,"“Simply cinnamon” is misleading… it contains mint! Not subtly, but overtly tastable! Call is Cinna-mint if it’s NOT simply cinnamon. Grrr! Disappointed is an understatement!"
,on,4,positive,I know one doesn’t eat toothpaste but one still has to be able to tolerate the taste of it and I thought this stuff was awful
,June,2021,negative,"I hate mint toothpaste, which is exactly why I bought this 'cinnamon' flavored one. Nope, it's full of mint with the barest hint of cinnamon. My teeth were sore and sensitive for 2 days after using this. Won't be buying again."
,on,19,negative,"I love himalaya products, but on this cinnamon toothpaste, I just didn't like the taste."
,on,10,positive,Tastes better than some
,on,13,negative,"You would think if the flavor is called “simply cinnamon”, it would have a predominately cinnamon flavor. But this has mint and tastes like mint. Fine for most, but I was looking for a cinnamon flavored toothpaste for a kid with an aversion to mint, and this isn’t it. Waste of money for me."
,on,31,negative,NOT GIVING MEDICAL OR DENTAL ADVICEWORST dental check-ups I've had since I was a child.My dentist asked me point plank what I was doing not using a fluoride toothpaste.
,on,14,negative,"At first I really hated the taste, but it is starting to grow on me. It cleans my teeth well, but I think I'll be trying a different toothpaste when this runs out."
,on,24,neutral,Not a great cinnamon flavour
,April,2021,negative,Sabe muy mal. Deja los dientes bastante bien.
,April,2021,positive,Die Zahnpasta schmeckt zu stark und zu scharf nach Zimt. Sie schäumt recht gut und die Zähne werden schön glatt.Leider finde ich sie zu teuer.
,on,2,positive,"If you like the vague aroma of a 1980s hospital (or possibly, stale cloves), this toothpaste is for you."
,on,11,negative,Bad flavor. Be cautious
,on,4,positive,"""Simply Cinnamon"" is inaccurate. Dr Bronner's cinnamon has menthol crystals in it (they are good for oral care) but it's not overly minty, as this one is. Cinnamon toothpaste should be warm and comforting - this one assaults the mouth with mint. If you like mint, you should be good."
,on,5,negative,"Very unlike most cinnamon toothpastes.  It is very spicy and painful to use, with a strong flavour, that is not cinnamon.  And very dissapointed that it cannot be returned as well. Beware of buying this product, it is not at all what it should be"
,November,2019,negative,"È da qualche mese che lo uso. All'inizio tutto bene. Da circa un mese ho avuto dei problemi al mattino (irritazione in bocca e labbra  gonfie). Tra l'altro bruciore in bocca  quando lavo i denti con questo dentifricio, brucia tantissimo. L'ho sospeso e con cortisone mi è passato. Ho provato a rilavarmi i denti ma è ricominciato lo stesso problema, irritazione e labbra gonfie. Devo eliminarlo non fa per me."
,on,26,negative,"Kinda gummy and thick ... pasty might be the word? I mean, it's okaaaaaay .... just not super great. Messy."
,on,25,positive,"THIS NOT ONLY DOES NOT CLEAN WELL,IT TASTES HORRIBLE AND LEAVES A NASTY AFTERTASTE."
,on,22,positive,"this is ok, I like the cinnamon taste better than mint for sure in a natural toothpaste."
,on,4,positive,"I'm not that impressed with ingredients...could be more natural.Won't be ordering again. There are other products that are more natural, like the one from the Health Ranger. And I make my own: 1/2 organic coconut oil + 1/2 high quality baking soda + few drops essential oils: oregano, clove, lemon, etc whatever feels good."
,on,14,positive,The cinnamon is too strong. Other flavors I've tried are better
,on,16,negative,"I like flouride-free flavoursome toothpaste [which this certainly has]...""Cinnamon"" which was unfortunately overwhelmed by the flavour of""Neem"" [an over the top tea-tree oil, but worse smell and taste]. Had I read the description better i would not have bought it...used it for two days then binned it...that bad"
,on,7,negative,I love the brand for a lot of different items so I was really surprised the flavor was so bad. My mouth didn't feel clean til I used Listerine. Even then I couldn't get rid of the taste. Maybe it came from a bad batch? I stopped using it about 3 days later -- til I didn't feel so bad about wasting my money.
,on,22,negative,"I chose this toothpaste because it was 'simply cinnamon' too.  I was looking for something without mint.  I love the texture and taste, but because of the strong mint, can't use it.  Now I see it does say in the comments and questions that it contains mint, but I would have caught that had it been in the product description.  It has a 'no return' policy.  :("
,on,3,negative,The silica in it grinds your enamel down which makes your teeth feel rough. The longer I used it the more plaque would stick to my teeth.
,on,22,negative,It’s so hard to find a good toothpaste free of things I am allergic or sensitive to but this one was not it. No cinnamon smell or taste at all. It’s awful.
,on,24,negative,I liked nothing about this product. It tastes like peppermint which I have never liked. It advertised as Cinnamon but unless the put the wrong tooth paste it the tube at the factory. I’m so grateful I did not buy the three pack. BYER BE WARE. THIS STUFF TASTE AWFUL :(
,on,18,negative,I usually buy Theraneem toothpaste but decided to try something new. Wish I hadn't. This stuff tastes terrible! Extremely medicinal tasting. It is referred to as Simply Cinnamon but I don't taste any cinnamon at all. It tastes like what I imagine a band-aid would taste like.I did a full brushing in hopes that it might get better. It didn't. I was a bit nauseated when it was all over. Going back to my other paste....
,on,10,negative,"Not only does the page neglect to provide an ingredient list, it is deceptively called ""Simply Cinnamon"" and it states that it is a good alternative to mint.  What a lie! It contains menthol from mint!!!  I knew the second that I tasted it, the menthol is almost painful! It is not compatible with homeopathic remedies. (I hate being deceived!) It's going back!!!"
,on,27,positive,"Nice paste, good feel without all the bad for you ingredients"
,December,2020,positive,Troppo forte il gusto!Non riesco ad usarlo!
,on,2,negative,"My daughter likes cinnamon flavored toothpaste, but it's hard to find them without sodium laureth sulfate. We decided to try this one, but she said it just tasted weird. She's gone back to using peppermint, because she disliked the flavor of this one so much."
,June,2019,negative,"Ho acquistato questo dentifricio soprattutto perché tutte le recensioni lo definiscono delicato e gradevole, invece io lo trovo davvero molto forte. Faccio fatica ad usarlo. Anche mettendone pochissimo, mi dà quasi fastidio per quanto è forte. Ottimo dentifricio, ma non adatto a palati delicati."
,on,2,positive,"Medicine, chemical taste. NO cinnamon taste at all!"
,May,2022,negative,Sapore che non lascia fresco. In più la cannella macchia i denti
,February,2019,negative,"At first, the toothpaste was great until my lips started to swell up like a sausage! I liked the taste but this was not a good experience at all!"

1.0,September,2023,negative,"Says No Alcohol on the front but the ingredients say benzyl alcohol!
