2.0,January,2024,negative,"I've used it and got little results. Could be used for a month but don't use it regularly (my dentist also recommended the same) as it would decay your enamle. If your teeths are very yellow then go for some Desi jugads (home made remidies) or consult your dentist. It won't fully brighten your teeth but would give some result. Overall, could be used for a month or less but do not even think of using it regularly :)"
3.0,October,2023,positive,Good
3.0,September,2023,neutral,It's a normal toothpaste. Nothing Wow  about it. It does nothing just cleaning. If you are buying to make your teeth white don't go for it.
3.0,July,2023,positive,Ok
3.0,February,2023,negative,"Unexpected, I am on last I mean third almost getting over I brush my teeth 3 times a Day , not at all effective on my yellow stain , if U r looking for Whitening its complete fake its just normal toothpaste"

2.0,September,2023,neutral,Your teeth will never become white if you use this paste
2.0,September,2023,negative,Not very good just value of money
2.0,June,2023,negative,It is peeling my skin on my lips If I use it twice a day. The product mentioned to use 3 times a day but when I used it my lips became completely chapped and It took me till a week to recover my lips.
1.0,October,2023,negative,"I am trying all Indian brands of toothpaste until I can settle on one I like. This one leaves my teeth feeling gritty after a few days. It doesn’t compare well with the foreign brands I usually use. But taste is better than others. The toothpaste is semi liquid, and hardly stay on the toothbrush. Also a problem with Indian toothpastes."
3.0,September,2022,positive,"Whitening capabilities are just a sham, I am doing this review after 6 months of usage. Nope, your teeth won't turn white as they say. But it gives great freshness, so I am fine with that."
3.0,February,2022,neutral,"After using this for a month I can say this somewhat helps Making the teeths white. But not as bright as I expected and shown on packaging. Also the taste is very weird, but you'll get used to once you start using it.I would prefer a regular toothpaste from next time."
3.0,July,2022,negative,Packaging was not good for this product . Kindly make the product value for money and donot send a defected product to us .thnks
3.0,June,2022,neutral,As I drink so much coffee we all know what happens.  This product works only a little but doesn't whiten too much
3.0,September,2022,neutral,Freshness is there but no whiteness
3.0,September,2020,neutral,Been using this for 2 months now and I don't see any results. I've been avoiding foods that stain teeth but still I don't see much results. Giving it three stars as it leaves a fresh feeling in my mouth otherwise it's just a waste of time and effort if you wanna use it for whitening purposes.
1.0,September,2023,negative,Not worthit it does't white your teeth totally worst . It just like normal toothpaste
3.0,July,2022,positive,Supper

3.0,November,2021,neutral,Gutka ke dag nikalne me success nahi raha
3.0,August,2014,negative,"Brushing with this paste 3 times a day seems to make your teeth a bit sensitive, so I also ended up having to brush once a day with a sensitive relief paste, and seemed crazy to be brushing 4 times a day!The minty taste lingers in your mouth for a couple of minutes, although the freshness not for all that long. Should go for a mouth wash after too.While my teeth seem better, I do not believe they are 1 shade whiter, but I did miss the afternoon brush on a couple of occasions. Going to continue on this paste with 3x brushing for the month. Will update the review if anything changes."

1.0,August,2023,positive,
1.0,September,2022,negative,"This is just false advertisement. It wont do anything special but clean your teeth like a regular toothpaste. Whitening? hell no. In fact my teeth started to turn yellow. Could be due to the excess of fluoride it contains. whatever. I wont buy it again. It belongs to the fairness cream category, just fancy branding."
3.0,September,2018,neutral,It's an ordinary toothpaste. Keeps your teeth clean if brush regularly just like any other toothpaste. Doesn't make your teeth 'one shade whiter' as the company claims.Bought the 200 gm. pack only because I got it in the lightning deal @ Rs. 79.
3.0,October,2015,negative,Don't believe that you will see changes in a week as advertised.I have been using this product for 3 months and I have seen some visible change in the color of my teeth. I drink lots of Tea so this toothpaste helped me to regain some whiteness which I lost.. Even though the price is higher its worth to spend. But believe me its a slow process and you wont find any difference if u check everyday.may a couple of months will make a differnce worth noticeable

3.0,August,2023,positive,For the first couple of weeks you will feel it's good to whiten your teeth but after sometime your illusion will break... No doubt it has a effect of freshness but not whitening. Very much costly according to working capacity of product.

By this time the return period was over. Hence, I do not have any option other that writing this review. I have purchased such deals in the past. However, this is the first time I had this issue.

1.0,December,2019,positive,The most awful experience!!!
2.0,November,2020,negative,"I got this in Rs 88/- so it was good for the price. The brushes are fine. Covers are not so good. Open from behind, it doesn't fit properly and keeps sliding out. If each brush had a seperate packaging, it would be easier to store it. Haven't used the brush yet so can't give feedback on that, will update later."
1.0,October,2019,negative,Delivered sensodyne brushes instead of coalgate
1.0,July,2020,negative,What I received is not soft bristles while on packet it mentioned soft bristles. Seems it is a fake toothbrush selling as soft bristles in name of colgate.
,October,2021,negative,"The package is half open, the toothbrushes are dirty. I had to throw everything away."
,June,2022,negative,"If you can get over them smelling like a moldy Barbie swimming pool set, then go for it. I used them once and never again. Too bad, cool pastel colours and brushing was fine."
,August,2023,negative,The bristles of this super soft toothbrush were not as soft as I was expecting. The bristles then harden after use.
,June,2023,negative,"Package came in damaged, taped up, cracked plastic and water damage on the back. There is a smell to the back of the packaging, will be returning."
,April,2023,negative,The product arrived open and taped together. The product is not for sale in North America and appeared to have been used.
,on,1,negative,The packaging was different than what is listed here. There or words in the Chinese language. The bristles are nice and soft but the handle is where the smell is coming from. So every time I brush I smelled that toxic smell. Amazon wants me to physically return it so that they can resell it so beware. You might just get my old ones
,on,11,positive,"These are totally mislabeled as ""soft."" They are not. I've bought these in the past, and was happy with the softness, which helped me with my sensitive teeth and gums... But now they've changed. They aren't nearly as soft as they used to be. They hurt my gums... So my search for properly ""soft"" brushes continues..."
,on,28,neutral,"I wanted a gentle soft toothbrush for my sensitive teeth and gums. This is not soft. Medium at best. Fine otherwise, but I still have to buy a soft toothbrush,  so money wasted for me."
,on,1,negative,"As toothbrushes go these really are gentle and do the job, However, they are NOT battery operated. So don't expect that when you make your purchase."
,on,24,neutral,"Not ultra soft, as advertised. More like your standard soft toothbrush."
,on,13,positive,Average
,on,14,negative,I don't know who decided to call those sensitive tooth or soft brushes. They are the opposite.
,on,2,negative,I would not buy these toothbrushes. They are not meant for US market. Poor quality… not durable…
,on,23,negative,"They’re cheap and I see why. The side bristles fray so easily and then they’ll make small cuts and abrasions on the sides of your mouth despite the bristles supposedly being soft. The whole point of having soft bristles is for heavy handed people but these clearly aren’t soft at all. I’m just gonna go back to the old soft bristle toothbrush brand i used before and toss these out, they’re absolute garbage."
,on,10,negative,"The actual product package was cut open along the bottom and a big hole in the outer plastic.Might as well taken the toothbrushes out of the packing and threw them in a box to ship.Fortunately, it doesn't look like the actual toothbrushes were damaged."
,on,28,neutral,The hardness of the toothbrush is definitely not ultra soft. It is more of a normal/medium brush. The brush causes gum pain and bleeding
,on,9,neutral,"These felt like typical soft toothbrushes, and didn't seem extra soft at all.  Ok bargain, but if you are looking for those super soft bristles, that are like velvet, these aren't it."
,on,4,neutral,"These are not soft toothbrushes, medium at best. The heads are small slightly bigger than a children's toothbrush. The packaging clearly stated not for sale in the USA. I guess, except for Amazon"
,on,18,neutral,Not extra soft......
,on,26,negative,"Extremely disappointed in these toothbrushes.  I didn't look at the country of origin closely and the tooth brushes themselves were very stiff and not for sensitivity teeth/gums.  Looking at the markings these should have been ultra soft bristles, instead they are probably the equivalent of medium.  Very stiff."
,on,4,negative,These were very hard and made my gums bleed.
3.0,February,2024,positive,Quality and price is not reasonable little bit high
1.0,January,2024,negative,This is the worst toothbrush i have seen. It is not at all soft bristles. Moreover it is mere a designer brush and doesn't fulfill the requirement.I couldn't imagine that colgate manufacturing such useless toothbrush.Please don't buy.Thanks.

3.0,December,2023,negative,"I tried this as I read that this brush has many more bristles than other brushes, but this is too soft to use after using the standard type for 3 decades. I'll try for another month and will update the review if I feel any different. It reaches the corners of mouth much better, but it's just too soft."
3.0,December,2023,negative,Not worth of money little bit coastly as compared to other brushes and brushes aren’t soft
3.0,October,2023,positive,"Old looking Colour's,.Sometimes feels hard.."
3.0,October,2023,positive,Okay
3.0,March,2023,negative,"I was looking for a replacement to Colgate Charcoal toothbrush which I am using for years. I ordered this after seeing the description and reviews, expecting softer bristles but turns out it has similar softness to charcoal one, just that bristle density is high. It does feel a bit soft but for initial few uses only.A bit disappointed with the brush, considering its costing more than double of what charcoal one costs and the term ultrafoam it a bit misleading. So, I'll be going back to the previous one.Only pros would be ergonomic soft handle and high density of bristles.You may go for it, if you want wider coverage i.e. cover more area in less time."
2.0,January,2024,negative,Bristles are NOT soft. After 4 days shape distorted
3.0,September,2023,positive,Feels like a medium soft not a ultra soft  brush
2.0,November,2023,positive,"I bought it after seeing ads on Instagram then I found out that 10k plus bristlles are good at cleaning teeths but, honestly I would go simple brush with soft brittles."
3.0,July,2021,positive,"Bought this toothbrush for myself and my wife and we were happy with the coloring scheme.The brush head was very small but it helped in taking the right amoumt of tooth paste and we never had the problem of taking extra toothpaste than required.The bristles were very densely packed, never used anything like this before. This certainly gave me much better confidence in cleaning each tooth and I was able to concentrate on the right areas for cleaning.The bristles were very soft and never harsh on the gums. At the same time the dense and pointed bristles was able to clean much better than my previous regular sized toothbrushes.But I have been notificing this issue of bristles in the lower end of the toothbrush being bent of at angle when taken right out of the box. I saw this on the enamel protection series as well. This looks like quality wasn't taken care much by Colgate. In this pack of 2 only 1 brush had this bent brsitles but seems common in the new series from Colgate.Handle of the toothbrush is soft to grip and strong to prevent bending.Overall a good toothbrush for cleaning tooth, but price is higher and quality of bristles alignment is something that should be looked upon."
2.0,December,2023,positive,Bristles size is too small. Colgate gentle enamal is much better toothbrush.

3.0,January,2023,positive,THE BRISTLES CAME OFF FROM THE BRUSH WHEN I KEPT IT IN THE TRAVEL BAG DURING MY TRAVEL VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE QUALITY
1.0,November,2023,negative,"One of the worst product from Colgate. The description says ultra soft, which is a joke.May be it has too many bristles too close to each other which makes the brush super hard and punishing on gums.This being one of the most expensive brush, its absolutely not worth."
2.0,September,2023,neutral,Not ‘so soft’ as per description
3.0,October,2022,positive,No bang for the buck but good brushes but Colgate should have made it in India or any other country than China. Will buy them if they would be made in India.

1.0,September,2023,negative,"Forget ultra soft, this brush made my gums bleed within 2 days of trying. The head is so small that it doesn’t go to corners, and when I did try to make it reach to the corners, it hurt my gums so bad that it will take at least 2 weeks to recover. I just don’t understand why would you do this, Colgate? I’m so hurt!"
1.0,December,2023,positive,Poor quality
1.0,September,2023,negative,This toothbrush is so expensive but is totally useless1. It is so small that you will feel like its a childs toothbrush2.

3.0,October,2022,neutral,Image shows ultra soft but it is little bit hard. This is may be medium. So not fit to children's.
1.0,October,2023,negative,It's a rubbish thing ... I will not even call it a toothbrush. It's absolutely inconvenient and harsh. It is not good for tooth cleaning at all. Wondering how can this be launched without a trial !! Ekdam bakwas.
3.0,October,2021,negative,Bristles are soft but they are joint in a way that it makes brushing as if it’s with hard bristles. Design is cute but better toothbrushes are available in the market with price way lesser than this. Not helpful if you have super sensitive gums which tend to easily swell.
3.0,November,2022,neutral,No softness was there as I hope

1.0,August,2023,positive,You can easily get good toothbrush in 60rs from local shop... Company has mentioned that this toothbrush have soft bristles which is completely false.
1.0,September,2023,negative,Everything is wrong with this brush. The head size and cleaning process every single thing is wrong. Buy at your own risk.
2.0,January,2023,negative,Too much expensive not worthNever buy online this product from any app.West of money.
3.0,May,2022,positive,Handle is too long for the kids.
1.0,June,2023,negative,"Well, to begin with, this toothbrush has a ball like head with tightly packed bristles in a small space with a flower design that can clean everything except your teeth, or gums for that matter.Colgate has to get serious inputs from consumers before making such products."
2.0,February,2023,positive,Its big...can be good for 5 plus age kids .
3.0,August,2022,positive,Nice
2.0,September,2022,negative,"It is infact very soft. However whats the use of a product if the bristles start to fall off in first use, that too in my mouth while brushing. 4-5 others started falling flat. Who expects this quality from colgate"
1.0,September,2023,negative,It’s is very hard
1.0,July,2021,negative,1. The product description says it has small head so that it becomes easy to reach the teeth at the back. So I switched from sensodyne to this. But this did not solve the purpose. Plus the bristles!2. The bristles are so densely packed that it becomes difficult to move the head around the teeth.3. And the middle pink part as you can see in the picture has thicker bristles than the white border ones. Design is just so wierd. My sensodyne is far better than this and much softer.CONCLUSION- I'm gonna use this brush to clean something else than my teeth. Use sensodyne it's nuch better. I'll probably have to change my technique so as to clean the back teeth well too.Please brush your teeth twice.YouTube- there's a channel called supa dental. He talks about how to correctly brush your teeth. I watched that video and it really does help.
1.0,October,2022,negative,"This tooth brush is a health hazard! It's bristles come off each time I use it and it's a risk that the plastic bristles would be swallowed! Amazon should remove this item listing urgently as swallowing plastic is a serious health hazard!Also, the base of the bristles become dirty and you can't clean the brush well because the bristles are so fragile that they come off.This is a total disastrous product, stay away from it if you don't love to swallow plastic!"
3.0,February,2021,positive,I have extra sensitive teeth. The head of the brush is ok but the bristles are not soft enough to not be abrasiveI am afraid this will damage my teeth more

1.0,July,2023,negative,There are toothbrushes way better than this also it says it's soft but it's not
1.0,July,2023,neutral,The bristles part is very very small. As a result it doesn't cover much of the mouth cavity and one will have to toil hard while brushing. Very expensive.

2.0,October,2021,neutral,"Main function of a brush is to clean. No matter how much foam it produces, if it can't reach all the places, it becomes pointless. Which is exactly what happens in the case of this brush. Please look for some other kind and don't waste your money on this."
2.0,December,2022,negative,Not good
1.0,August,2023,negative,Durability is very poor
1.0,December,2022,neutral,The toothbrush is neither ultra soft nor very gentle to the gums. The bristles may be soft individually but are too densely attached to the brushhead for comfort. The item is imported from China and is expensive compared to other similar toothbrushes.Overall we don't feel comfortable using these brushes.

1.0,February,2022,negative,"Bristles are really soft but they're arranged in a way that, when u brush, they don't separate and clear the dirt against teeth or in-between, not cleaning much AT ALL.I had to brush again with old toothbrush. Need to buy a new different brush.Waste of money.To describe it exactly, it's like brushing teeth with soft rubber sponge, it rubs against teeth well, really soft, just won't clean a thing."

1.0,April,2021,negative,"Had bought it seeing the reviews and the innovative concept, but this is not worth the money. The head is too little and the neck connecting the head is very weak- so when pressure is given on the back molars, the neck just bends so much that it seems like it'll break any time. Thinking what will I do with the other one- thinking of use it for my 5 yr old son.Not buying again."

2.0,October,2023,negative,"The brush used to be good when it was initially launched. Off late, it's become really bad. The size of each bristle is different and some of them are sharp and hard. Either we are getting defective products or the company changed its design of the bristles. The latest brushes hurt my gums and caused  bleeding. I suggest not to buy it."
3.0,August,2023,negative,Brush is very soft.
3.0,July,2021,positive,"The reason I bought this is because of thr word enamel protection as my mom had issues with her enamel.4 brushes for Ra.240 is definitely the real price and in my opinion I won't think it as a buy 2 get 2 free marketing. The price is on the higher end of it's really a buy 2 get 2.The pink color is repetitive. I wish all 4 tooth brush had different colors and a tad darker than current one as current one in morning light looks very pale.The brush is definitely very soft and extra wide. The extra wide is helping cleaning all sides of the teeth better and is also not harsh.But in all the new series of colgate tooth brushes like the extra foam, enamel protection series am seeing a couple of bristles at the bottom end of the brush head in a slanting position or bend at angle, I see it might be a manufacturing issue. Out of 4 brushes 2 had this issue where 3 or 4 bristles were not straight.The density is good enough and all bristles had good thin edges.Overall a good toothbrush but pricing is high, colors could have been different and all bristles should be straight"
1.0,January,2021,negative,"I am writing this review after using this variant of Toothbrush for approximately 2 months. Obviously purchased these after seeing 4.5 rating for this product, but there is nothing special about this toothbrush for sure.* This brush is supposed to have Ultra-Soft bristles, which are usually advised to people with sensitivity in their mouth, in my experience, the bristles were medium-soft and as you start to use them down the week, they turn to medium. I tried to clear up the residue by soaking the bristles in baking soda, but sadly this did not happen. So please don't fall prey to false advertising, this brush has medium-soft bristles.* The product claims to be gentle on gums but owing to the above reason, I don't see how this is possible.* The bristles are arranged in plateau layout or simply arranged in a flat with no raised bristles at the tip of the toothbrush which makes it impossible to clean the hard to reach places of your upper molars, this means if you are using this brush, forget about getting 100% clean teeth. I could actually feel a plaque build-up in places where I knew the bristles are not able to reach.* The neck of the toothbrush is not flexible enough, even cheap toothbrushes have better maneuvering than this toothbrush.* This toothbrush just looks fancy but sadly it did not work for me as of yet!Giving it 1 star for the build quality."

1.0,October,2023,negative,"Opposite of marketing.Try to brush your front teeth unless you’re doing something really crazy it’s gonna touch your gums and it hurts on the gums.Regardless of that the size is still quite uncomfortable, so brushing the wisdom teeth and the shape does not fit comfortably."
3.0,December,2021,positive,Product bristles are not that soft like how seller's or colgate it self are portraying. Bristles are not too hard nor too soft.. just ok like sensodin toothbrush. They're talking high money just because of the classy and royal look of the product.

3.0,June,2021,negative,"I don't know why companies feel the need to add so much menthol or whatever it is that tingles and burns in mouthwash and toothpaste. It says ""Doesn't burn"" but it does. I've used Listerine in the past and that was horrible. This is much better but not ideal. It's still uncomfortable for me, burns my inner cheeks a bit and I can't wait for the 30 seconds to get over.Won't be repurchasing!!"
1.0,October,2023,negative,I don't know how are people even giving it good reviews. I couldn't believe Colgate would put out a product so bad. The bitter aftertaste was just horrendous.
3.0,December,2022,positive,A
2.0,January,2023,negative,The freshness as others have said is not that good on top of that it leaves a very bitter taste in your mouth which doesn't go away even after gargling a few times. It's just better to go with Listerine in my opinion
3.0,July,2021,neutral,"1. Not as strong as listrien, that doesn’t mean I am saying to buy listrien.2. Mild and doesn’t feel much difference.3. I changed from listrien to this because of some offer but again switching back to listrien."
3.0,October,2022,positive,Hi
3.0,November,2020,neutral,"Only thing I didn't like about it at first was It's sweet taste.  Tastes better after dilution with water.It's alcohol free, no burning sensation. Freshness and after taste for 1-2hr.Have been using it for few months now twice a day and still almost half of bottle is remaining."
3.0,June,2021,negative,"I bought this since it is alcohol-free. But I didn't like the taste much. Listerine tastes better but has alcohol. Also, this got done very fast. I will probably not purchase this again."

1.0,August,2022,negative,I developed mouth ulcers after using it for 5-6 days. And got bleeding. They must be using alcohol in it which I think damaged my cheek tisssues from within. Don't use this. Use homemade product. I regret buying it.
1.0,March,2022,negative,Colgate Max Plax is worst mouthwash ever as it contains Cetylpyridinium chloride which causes brown stains on your teeth. Don't ever buy it.

1.0,March,2023,neutral,Not the value product loss of money
3.0,September,2017,neutral,"This product has no class in comparison to it's international version. Disappointed. Doesn't create that clean taste in the mouth, nor does the aftertaste last very long. Will not prevent bad breath."

You guys better stay away from the green tea flavour.Others go for it."
3.0,July,2016,positive,Good enough. Not as strong as listerine.It says no alcohol or whatever.But does the job like it should. Taste is quite ok too.

3.0,November,2023,negative,It's made in China but product specifications says Origin is India
1.0,August,2022,negative,"The product just stopped working in 90 days. The other negative thing about the product is that.a. It uses 2 AAA batteries. My previous Oris B used only 1.b. It does not have a 4 x 30-second timer, a standard feature in other brushes.I bought this product with a lot of hope as Colgate is a premium brand. Unfortunately, it did not meet the expectations they had created with their toothpaste and other dental care products.I am a Colgate Shareholder and am happy that electric toothbrush is not their main stay product."
3.0,October,2023,negative,After putting fresh cells not functioning
3.0,August,2023,negative,Circular movement of brush only
2.0,December,2023,negative,Replacement heads are VERY expensive. Will switch to another brand.
2.0,May,2023,negative,"Pros: The vibrations are good in intensity.Cons: Short handle - most people will also be gripping the brush head, quite unlike others. Its not really a con, bt does feel different.  The brush itself has long bristles and is a tight fit for the rear teeth. As a result, it appears to not clean the rear teeth as well as some others.  The brush head fixing arrangement is bad - it's a push fit without a positive lock. Every time you wipe the brush handle - the brush head comes off. Most others use a twist lock that avoids this."
3.0,June,2023,positive,Brush was very good while it worked but got damaged very soon.
3.0,May,2023,neutral,Rechargable electric tooth brush are available in this range.Don't buy this.
3.0,April,2023,negative,Power of this toothbrush is not enough for daily use
3.0,April,2022,positive,"Decent budget friendly product, only cons are the 30 sec timer to turn the brush is not noticeable and it uses battery instead of usb charging, so you need to replace the batteries at a regular interval. Other than these cons, I really liked the product, and I would say it is a good start to my electronic toothbrush journey."
2.0,April,2022,negative,"I don't generally write review of the products but I am so disappointed by this purchase that I don't want the same thing to happen to anyone else.Cons/Dislike - No user manual is included in the product. Wait. It's there but it's printed in Chinese.- Inspite of being an Indian Brand, Except for the ""Colgate"" written on the brush and packing, there is nothing Indian about this product. While receiving and opening the packaging, I literally felt that I am living in China.- It says that there is a 30 second vibration indication but I have never felt it.Pros - They give AAA batteries with the product. And that's it.Don't buy this. Go for Real me or Mi toothbrush. For that matter, go for anything but this one."
3.0,August,2020,negative,"The product is easy to use, but comes with a operating cost a lot higher when compared to the existing toothbrushes in the market. They do come with batteries inside the packaging however, when looked into the initial investment, and the money one needs to spend on the clip on brush refils, it might not make sense. As per the advice, one needs to change the toothbrush after every three months.The most pivotal factor on deciding on a toothbrush however, is the ergonomics anduser experience. The only thing you'll notice right off is your urge to return back to a 'Manual' - 'Muscle-Powered' toothbrush."
3.0,March,2022,positive,Good size and shape. Maybe easy to use. But pls go for recharging ones. You can definitely try the one from caresmith which I have been using for many many months now.
3.0,September,2022,positive,Electric brash vibration make sometime uncomfortable. But it's clean Bater than normal brash
3.0,August,2020,negative,Please be cautious and only use if advised by doctor. it cleans the oral parts well. Strong vibrations. Would be good if had rechargeable batteries. Had sinus problem after using it. Still not sure if the brush caused it or was it something else. Had pain in upper area of face like nose bone and near eye lid. Hence stopped using frequently. I use it twice a week. Cleans as expected.
2.0,July,2020,neutral,"This product worked well for exactly a month. I've been facing an issue since the past 10-12 days. The brush STOPS vibrating automatically after every 2-3 seconds, I have to keep clicking the button everytime I want it to vibrate. If I had to do that I would have used a simple brush which would've cost me 10% of what I paid for this. I've never allowed any water to go in the battery pack or any other joints, just have been wiping the bristles head after use.There seems to be no way to contact anyone regarding this issue. Also noting that there isn't any mention of Warranty or Guarantee here on the product description. Seems like they meant the product to be in a 'Buy it at your own Risk' criteria. Never expected a renowned company such as Colgate to not concentrate about customer relation segments for their electric products."
3.0,May,2022,neutral,Easy to use but not value Of money because it does not help you to clean . It just vibrations.
3.0,July,2022,neutral,"The pack says it comes with a replaceable head, but came with only batteries"
3.0,October,2020,positive,Product itself was good do not expect excellent brushing quality its average but it broke in 3 days i dropped it from 3 feet and it stopped working product could be made little strong as it is intended to use in washroom and it can be slippery
3.0,May,2022,positive,Do not compare with other brandsits cheap and good product
3.0,July,2022,neutral,It's just a normal brush with some vibrations
3.0,July,2021,neutral,"Although I ordered the black charcoal , they sent me a white brush but that's OkThis brush just vibrates and No rotation...I missed this part to check"
3.0,June,2022,positive,Better to use normal brush
3.0,July,2021,positive,Unable to open to reload battery... Used for month it was nice.. But if battary can't be replaced it's not advisable.. But it was nice product...
3.0,July,2020,positive,It's an average product. For a first time attempt it is totally recommended. The batteries also stay for a month if you use twice a day for 6-8min each time.cleaning is satisfactory. But mostly in future never use it again.
2.0,February,2023,positive,Oral b brush is much better
1.0,May,2023,negative,Please don’t buy this product I bought it because I trusted Colgate but I am totally disappointed. This brush is only vibrating is not the brush is not moving at all and also it sounds very annoying that make me headache. So please don’t buy
3.0,March,2021,positive,It is good quality but not that effective. There is no motor to move the bristles. The bristles only vibrate a little to make the paste spread.
3.0,February,2021,positive,"The product looks good, but it is not made in India as stated in the description.Does it amount to any breach as per law?"
1.0,September,2023,positive,
3.0,July,2021,negative,Its vibration may cause other problems for gum and teeth
1.0,July,2023,positive,"Earlier I used to use Braun Automatic toothbrush.It was silent, built quality was superb compared to this."
1.0,March,2023,negative,Poor product. Doesn’t last. I bought mine in Jan and I’m discarding it in March. I’ve changed the battery. Also changed the brush head. Nothing works; it runs for a few seconds and then dies.So I’m forced to discard it. In under 3 months!
1.0,October,2022,negative,"The brush head is too small, it seems like a kids brush. It just vibrates at the bottom not even near the brush head. It’s like using a regular kids toothbrush that vibrates in your hand, instead of your mouth. Don’t but this, use a regular toothbrush. I realised electric toothbrushes are gimmicky after using this product."
2.0,October,2022,negative,The head vibrations are weird and uncomfortable.  The really small head makes brushing a longer task now.
1.0,May,2023,neutral,"Stopped working randomly after 7 months. There is no warranty of any kind as well. Would expect a product of this price and brand to last longer,not an economical toothbrush at all."
1.0,July,2023,positive,Very small brushes and cheap quality dnt buy guys
3.0,June,2020,neutral,"no original  replacement head available... i shall give 5 star if original replacement head is available, u may use 360 head (then why someone eager to buy this product?)"
3.0,March,2021,positive,This is good but not that effective  ..... more battery consumption
2.0,April,2022,neutral,The Brush stopped working in 6 months and there is no warranty or help given by Amazon or Colgate. Choose a different brand.
2.0,March,2020,negative,"It has only nad only vibration function. The bristle area is not flexible, so it does not move at all, just like a tooth brush we have been using for ages. Ibstead, check out pepsodent or other bramd and look outfor those additional functions  that too at a very competitive price. This one is not worth - price wise and utility wise."
3.0,March,2020,negative,"The brush head vibrates but doesn't rotate, so cleaning is not as good compared to the ones in which brush head rotates."
1.0,June,2022,positive,
3.0,February,2020,neutral,The electric brush is not as expected.It's brisstle doesn't vibrate at good speed.Only it's base vibrate.
1.0,June,2022,positive,Initially it felt as a good product but it stopped working within a month. I’m not very fond of writing reviews but I’m doing this for a cause.  I urge you guys to stop wasting your money on this rather buy bamboo brush and contribute to the environment. Thank you
3.0,October,2019,neutral,Not so automatic.I need use it like a normal brush to actually  clean  my teeth.Costly
1.0,March,2023,negative,It’s stopped in 6 months. Why to pay 800 bucks for it. Disappointed by this product. It was not expected from Colgate.
3.0,January,2020,positive,Cap should also be provided. How will one keep it without bruch cap
1.0,May,2023,negative,The toothbrush is so bad it's burst is not moving

1.0,April,2023,negative,"Despite changing the batteries, the product has completely stopped working in less than 10 months"
1.0,May,2022,negative,"The vibrations on this are too strong and hurt my gums really bad. I have very bad pain on one side of my mouth now, unable to eat even soft foods like bread. Wouldn't recommend for folks with already persistent gum disease definitely"
1.0,June,2022,positive,"The quality of the unit and the built-in timer provided in the brush. It stopped functioning properly in less than a month and if timer does not work, the brush is as good as a child's brush and not at all effective."
3.0,September,2020,positive,Ok. Serves the purpose.
1.0,July,2021,negative,"on two consecutive purchases of this product, i faced the same problem. after a few days of use the timer stops the vibration erratically at short intervals. changing the battery does not help. since it happened on two products, bought on two different occassions, it must be a inherent problem. poor design and low end defective product being dumped in india."
1.0,August,2022,negative,It just doesnt do what an electric toothbrush is supposed to do. The bristles dont rotate at all. Two rubber bristles keep vibrating for no good reason and purpose. Waste of money!
1.0,March,2023,negative,Not reliable brush worked fine for three months and then  it's not working at all now
1.0,April,2022,negative,"Product not same as shown in the description,it is irritating Vibration when we use! Not recommended,waste of money!And most important thing is there is no return policy so our money is wasted! I'm so disappointed!"

3.0,October,2019,positive,The vibration is too strong
2.0,October,2020,negative,It’s useless as the battery goes of soon and not rechargeableBetter to buy other better and cheaper brands
1.0,November,2022,neutral,The brush only functioned for the first time and later never turned on.
2.0,August,2020,negative,Toothbrush is too intense on the teeth. It is nothing more a vibrating stick. Read reviews.
1.0,July,2022,negative,"Pathetic design stops working after a few seconds, changed the battery still the same, was not expecting it to be this bad."
1.0,February,2021,negative,I have bought two of these and honestly the vibration it provides with the 2 minute timer is useless. The cost is high in terms of function and quality. Better to go for a different brand or at least a different functionality brushing. Vibration doesn’t really help.
1.0,November,2019,negative,"A complete waste of money! I bought it one month ago, and already the 2 minute timer doesn't work. It stops working after a few seconds and you end up brushing your teeth manually! Optimistically bought two spare heads! Guess I'll have to throw the lot into the trash now. Thank you for the experience, Colgate. You've just lost one loyal customer."
1.0,June,2022,positive,"Got two toothbrushes, one works the other DOESN'T and amazon customer care was completely USELESS in helping out with this."

2.0,February,2020,positive,The look is good but the bristles are very soft and not Upto the mark
1.0,January,2020,negative,"It is just a Vibrating Brush, the head and body vibrates giving very little help in Brushing. I haved used Oral B,in which the head rotates and vibrates thus giving a fresh feel in the mouth. Also the batteries needs to be replaced as it does not come with a charger. DONT WASTE money on this product"
1.0,June,2022,negative,I did not like the product.. battery was missing product was not received as expected.
1.0,October,2021,positive,Colgate ProClinical 150 Charcoal Sonic Battery Powered Electric Toothbrush (with Replaceable Brush Head Included). Discription says extra brush heAd included but item arrived without extra brush head.
1.0,April,2022,neutral,"The brush head does not rotate, just vibrates very lightly. Confused as to how does it actually clean. Waste of money."

1.0,December,2022,positive,
1.0,February,2022,negative,I feel my money is wasted as it worked for just a month.  Would appreciate a replacement.
1.0,August,2021,negative,Product worked well but died after just 2 months of use. Replaced battery with Duracell but that didn’t help either. Would not recommend.
1.0,February,2021,negative,Stupid useless product. Received a product that potentially looks a used one. The bristles aren't even vibrating -_- Definitely a waste of time and money. A simple brush costing INR 20 would definitely do a better job than this does.
1.0,October,2022,negative,Not cleaning teeh as brush is not good.
2.0,February,2020,positive,Quite OKay...the only problem is battery was not working.
1.0,January,2021,positive,Not suitable for adults. Build quality is good. But not suitable for adults (very small size) so not usable. Tried returning but cannot do so. Suitable as a toy for kids use to familiarize them motorized toothbrush. No actual use.
1.0,January,2020,negative,I thought that this product would be different than other brands but unfortunately this is pathetic. Can not recommend this at all. Brush vibrates but it does not effectively clean. Horrible vibrations and makes pain in teeth if touched. Sound causes pain in ears.
1.0,February,2023,neutral,buying not recommedned
1.0,January,2022,neutral,"The toothbrush only vibrates, doesn't do any else. Don't buy this product if you are looking for a rotating toothbrush"
1.0,August,2020,negative,They are just charging for vibrator insertedI would recommend normal tooth brush insteadPlease its not at all worth youll should instead go for tooth brush which consists of rotator bristlesIg oral b
1.0,July,2022,negative,Purchased in May 2022 now stopped working in July 2022
1.0,January,2024,positive,"I bought it in April 2023 and started using from October 2023. It did a good job, however it stopped working since December 2023. It used to stop intermittent evrry few seconds and one fine day it to totally stopped rotating."
3.0,March,2022,neutral,"I have been using this product since 8 December 2021, once a day. The two AAA alcaline batteries last just about 3 weeks for this once a day use; so, it is expensive to use this toothbrush. The product is just ok. As for the results, I didn't see any difference between this one and a non-electric toothbrush. I have two major problems: (i) I travel a lot in connection with my work but it is difficult to carry along this toothbrush because the manufacturer (Colgate) didn't think of including a storage case; the product just came in a paper carton; and (ii) I cannot find a replacement head for this particular toothbrush on Amazon.in or in other websites. Therefore, once the initial head becomes unusable, I am afraid, the entire toothbrush becomes useless. Colgate should have cautioned its customers appropriately."
3.0,March,2022,positive,"Product is authentic and works fine.Basic version of electric brush. Only one control which is the Power ON and OFFIf switched ON, will run for 2 minutes and automatically switches OFF.Does the basic cleaning but not efficient like regular manual brushing.I could feel some areas not properly cleaned, that too at the front visible teeth, after 2 X Brushings of 2 minsProduct package was slightly damaged, but not a big issue."

1.0,October,2023,negative,Bristles very rough and sharp. Can damage enamel and gums of elderly. Cant use . Waste of money.
2.0,January,2023,negative,"Brushes are very soft and don't clean properly . Brushes should have been harder , and vibration should have been stronger - similar to the Philips machines"
1.0,December,2022,negative,"It's vibration causes some inconvenience/pain in my sensitive teeth after brushing  and more than that,  it's  sound is very very  irritating ... I can confidently say  Oral B electronic brush is much more better than this.. I lost my total money paid as I can't take any risk when it comes to my teeth and I am not going to use this any more ( I used this for only one day)"
3.0,June,2021,neutral,There’s a simple brush strip that vibrates left to right. No circular motion or brush as I’ve come to expect from powered toothbrushes. Disappointed.

3.0,April,2021,positive,??
3.0,November,2020,negative,Does the job. Nothing great
1.0,January,2020,negative,This gadget was pretty useless as a toothbrush to begin with (as it only vibrates the bristles). After 2 weeks it stopped working altogether. It now switches-on on its own (gave us a pretty good scare when it started vibrating in the holder in the dead of the night) and never does switch on when I actually want to brush my teeth. Don't waste your money on this stupid useless thing masquerading as a power toothbrush.
1.0,June,2023,positive,Bad
3.0,September,2020,positive,good cleaner
2.0,November,2020,negative,It stopped working within 2 months. Not at all good to use. There's no warranty also. It's like buying a 1000 rupees brush for 2 months
3.0,November,2019,positive,Good but not up to the mark
1.0,July,2021,neutral,Please don't buy it as there is no warranty or guarantee on this product. When I contacted the Amazon Support they told me there is nothing which can be done now as it has been one month and the return window is closed.Please don't waste your hard earned money on this.

1.0,June,2022,negative,"Worst product packaging.Sensitive product like this should have sealed package.This one look like torned,used product.Shame!"
1.0,November,2021,negative,Not good until brushes move. It's just normal brush with attached motor so that it vibrate nothing more than that. Please don't buy and waste your time
1.0,October,2022,negative,Don't like..
1.0,February,2021,negative,Dont waste money. Its just a vibrating tooth brush which actually hurt your teeth. Bristles are too small. I would rather use simple tooth brush. Not happy with the product.
1.0,March,2021,negative,Worthless. I am still wondering why did I buy.Manual toothbrush is way too better.Movement of bristles is not good enough to clean teeths.
1.0,April,2022,negative,Not good. Plus stopped working within 15 days. Also no warranty.
1.0,March,2020,negative,Worst product by Colgate. Marketing gimmick. The brush only vibrates. The bristles when in contact with teeth stop vibrating and whole jaw feels vibrations. No brushing only vibration. Return is not possible otherwise I would opt for return.
1.0,July,2021,negative,Matter pending .. not yet resolved.All suggestions tried .. still not working
1.0,February,2021,negative,The toothbrush didn’t even last one month. The quality of the bristles is bad. Absolutely not worth it!

1.0,December,2019,negative,I've always used a power toothbrush. Like oral b.  But this one is filled with issues.1. It's way too tiny. So there's not too much paste or even useful for the mouth.2. It's motor is more powerful than the requirement also. My gums start hitting after using this.3. After only 24 hours the brush stopped working and refused to turn on.

Oral b battery powered toothbrush was my first electric toothbrush and it was very good. This Colgate sonic toothbrush is waste of money. I suggest to buy rotating - oscillating toothbrush of oral b company, not any vibratory sonic toothbrush. I hope that it will help."

1.0,December,2022,negative,"The brush lasted only 8 months. I had bought it in May 2022, In Dec 2022 it is broken.The brush doesn't switch on.

1.0,December,2022,negative,This brush hurts the teeth. It does not give a smooth brushing exprerience. It feels like so much pressure is put on teeth with an unplesaant sound and feeling in the gums and teeth after brushing.It is better to go for Oral B or Philips
2.0,April,2022,negative,Common guys make the on and off button sensitive. You need to gym to press the off button.  Can't even return.
