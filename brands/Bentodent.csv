3.0,August,2023,negative,taste goodcleaning teeth averagefreshness averagerecommended NOI am confused about the thing there is no symbol of veg or non-veg. I am not going to buy it again.
2.0,September,2023,negative,"Has No Foam, so turns fully liquidy while Brushing, which then doesn't clean many areas of the mouth. The Mint flavor/smell exists only while Brushing, but disappears immediately once you flush your mouth with water. Absolutely does nothing to maintain Fresh Breath as all other toothpastes do! It's just like using a piece of raw charcoal to brush on teeth. It's the First Brand of Toothpaste that I actually threw out!"
2.0,November,2023,negative,Just a waste of money doest not work.
1.0,January,2024,negative,I like the Bentodent product but the packaging and delivery of Amazon is Awful.I’m extremely disappointed with Amazon’s careless methods in delivery.

3.0,October,2021,negative,The product quality is top notch. Easily migrated from the regular toothpaste. The only problem is of the packaging. The tube head cracks up. I have had two purchases but both of the time the tube cracks up & creates wastage & hassles. If the company focuses on a different package design this product can reach better success.

1.0,May,2023,negative,I always go for Indian product. I bites activated charcoal paste trust me I have very bad experience. Though sound natural but but I don’t feel a good experience after brushing teeth. The back ingredients you use spoil the basin which not removed easily. I don’t feel the freshness after brushing. You guys need to work out more with the product
2.0,March,2023,negative,While brushing feel like use roasted tobacco powder because of black color
2.0,October,2022,negative,"I tried to give this toothpaste a chance, I really did. But it sucks. I have an electric toothbrush and even that can’t make this toothpaste spread. It just gets stuck to your teeth sometimes. I couldn’t feel any freshness after brushing."

1.0,August,2021,negative,"I bught it after watching fittuber video. Used it for some days and began to see that teeth were becoming yellowish brown. I thought the reason could be something elase and started doing oil pulling and other things to remove the yellow stain. I somehow stopped using the paste forthe reason that, feel after brush was of something incomplete and teeth weren't smooth. My father who has been using the paste along with me found thathis teeth too started becoming yellow and they were almost brown in colour. This alarmed him and he stopped using the paste altogether. I am not questioning whether the paste is natural or not. I have no idea to be frank. But for sure from my and my father's experience this toothpaste for some reason makes teeth yellow."

1.0,December,2021,negative,"Charcoal is very toxic for teeth. Makes them sensitive. Sadly return isn't possible and I am stuck with two of them. American Dental Association has not found any evidence that charcoal toothpaste is safe or effective, and it may actually harm the teeth and gums. Charcoal toothpaste is advertised as a whitening agent that can remove particles from the teeth, but this is a misleading claim"
,July,2023,positive,The product is okay so so

3.0,December,2023,positive,Feels good to use SLS and praben free toothpaste...made my teeth yellow I think
2.0,February,2024,positive,No need to add stevia for sweet taste. This natural sweetener is also recently known for bad health effects. Should remove it as this paste is for health conscious people. Otherwise it is a good alternative for foamy pastes.
3.0,September,2023,negative,"Toothpaste when used in the morning, mouth is fresh for couple of hours and you start feeling as if you didn’t brush for rest of the day ( maybe because of less or no fluoride)It leads to bad breath and smells at times.Heard from a dentist friend that no fluoride toothpaste issues in long term can cause issues.So, I use Meswak during the day and Bentodent in the night before going to bed."

3.0,May,2022,neutral,I like this paste coz it has no fluoride. It's not foamy but alright by me. However I hv problem with the tube neck. It always break on pressure as we push the paste out. So it leaks from the crack. I advice company to make better quality tube.

3.0,January,2022,negative,"My kids dislike it for its bad taste. It's not clear whether the Toothpaste would be applied using a brush or a naked finger. Anyway, I am not happy with the product discontinued. Not recommend."

1.0,September,2023,negative,Add more cardmom to your cardmom flavoured toothpaste and add more mint to your menthol toothpaste  . Otherwise it’s just a waste of money. Very minor smell of cardmom or mint

1.0,November,2021,negative,I'm a regular user of this toothpaste but each time the tube cracks after using it for few days. Initially thought maybe the tube cracked due to my fault but each time it continues to happen then I understood the quality of tube is not good. We are paying way more price than regular paste... Why can't the company maintain a minimum standard in its packaging? Even though these many people have raised their concern about tube... They are not making any change!

1.0,July,2023,negative,Horrible taste.. feels like eating a super sweet paan first thing in the morning !!!
2.0,August,2021,positive,It will not help you to keep freshness long lasting. I was using Dant kanti before this and now again came back to it.

3.0,February,2023,positive,When I used first tube ( fresh breath and my kid liked it) was very good. I purchased the next combo pack( totally changed taste which my kid isn't accepting) which isn't good.
3.0,November,2021,positive,"I like it how it doesn't produce any foam and the freshness is very good but i bought a combo pack having 2 tubes! I found the first one i used very good but in the latter, i found that sometimes i couldn't even brush with even with small amount of paste would burn my mouth!

3.0,January,2022,positive,"This toothpaste is best to use for a change. Strong elaichi flavour and no foaming. Cleaning value is average. Instead better to go for Vicco, Sudanta or Dant Kanti"
1.0,February,2023,negative,"After watching YouTube videos on which is good ayurvedic toothpaste to used, I decided to try this cardamom flavoured toothpaste.. but utterly disappointed…1) it’s very sweet like pistachios ice cream2) don’t think it is ayurvedic medicine and will help oral health in long run as it has too much of sugar3) it is expensive4) never felt that I have cleaned my mouth5) I think sellers knows that customer will not buy again hence they are selling two pieces; no option to buy one piece"
1.0,October,2023,negative,Quality Is Poor I am Not Interested
3.0,December,2021,positive,Favour and freshness is very goodNot able to provide whitness to teeth.Pricy.foam free.
2.0,March,2023,positive,Ok ok
2.0,September,2020,positive,"Not only is this toothpaste fluoride free, it is binder free. (A binder in toothpaste is used to stabilize toothpaste formula to prevent separation of the liquid and solid components.) The paste disintegrates to a powder on the application of water, and falls from the brush before it does what it is supposed to do, abrade plaque. The taste of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) overrides the flavour of cardamom, leaving an unpleasant taste during use. So it's back to Dant Kanti for me."
3.0,March,2021,positive,"Nice cardamom taste and light smell. But, as it is foamless so, need to use more than any foam based toothpaste."

I loved the taste of cardamom flavor and enjoyed brushing twice a day with this.After about one month suddenly I discovered stain dots in mirror. On looking the inside, I was shocked. Several of my teeth is stained.I have never had this problem and I have always maintained good oral hygiene.Clearly this toothpaste is causing the stain."

2.0,June,2022,negative,Not useful in solving any tooth or  gum problems. Even normal toothpastes are better than this
2.0,September,2019,neutral,"Totally no foam. I gone with the claim of no fluoride, paraben, SLS etc. If there is no foam generated, you cannot have a proper brushing. How much quantity you apply, it does not generate foam and you finish your brushing in just 1 minute. Your dress will get spoiled for sure while brushing. Taste is equal to soil if you ever tasted soil. Totally useless paste for this price. Don't get fooled by 4 star rating."
2.0,September,2021,negative,Packaging is very poor. Attaching image for reference. I have used only 10% . Now as I can’t close tube properly. So no use of 90% remaining past.

3.0,August,2021,positive,"The toothpaste is really great but the packaging/tube for it is awful.Since the paste is less smooth/'liquidy' than most toothpastes, it gets too dried and hence the tube breaks/cuts from the top. Have bought 5+ tubes and all of them got the cut mid way of their usage.I hope the company reads these reviews and improve their tube quality soon."

3.0,May,2018,positive,"Seller: Indian Dental OrganizationPrice: 170/-Delivery:  6 days (Incl Sunday), 50/- Delivery Fee, BangalorePackage: Came in big box for a small tube!, no damageRecommended: yes, if you love foam-less brushing!After using Dabur paste for several years, recently came to light that it contains Methyl paraben which is on controversy discussion (whether it is harmful). So I don't want to take any risk any further and this paste came in to light. The paste contents appear all natural and almost no Preservatives (Going by the ingredient list). The paste looks grey color and it gets broken into pieces (True!) while you squeeze the tube to the bristles of your brush!. First time accidental flip will let all the paste fall on to your toes.This paste has no foam. Not sure if this is because of the lack of the preservatives. Foamless brushing is a bit risky if you have Medium or Hard brush type. You could possibly end up losing the tooth enamel!. I personally don't recommend this paste unless you have the awareness or if you have the habit of brushing so roughly!. The after brush feel is good because of Menthol. However, I feel that the menthol presence is little excess!.I recommend this product very much for it's complete natural. Even the famous Dabur Red advertises Ayurvedic but contains chemicals!, while this is free from all preservatives. However, foamless and the high price is the reason for 3 star. Hope my review is useful. Buy Natural and Be natural!"
1.0,December,2023,negative,My gums started to pain after a week of usage
3.0,August,2023,negative,Cleanses but you can have a feel that consistency is an issue and you can feel granular consistency after brush. No soapy foambrings somewhat less psychological aspect of not a good clean up.
2.0,January,2024,neutral,No need to waste money on this
3.0,August,2021,positive,"The toothpaste is good. Quite good tha. The commercial ones we get in the market. But this is the second time I am experiencing same problem. The nozzle of the toothpaste leaks from the side. By the time the toothpaste is half, the nozzle neck almost tears out. It means packaging of toothpaste is faulty. If this can be rectified, it would be good."
3.0,March,2021,negative,"Pls ses the pic and you will realise how poor is the manufacturing of tube. The seam is cracked and paste comes out of that place. This has happened for the 2nd time. 1st time i had complained yo the company of 2 paste with similar cracks. They replaced it, but the replacement again shows the crack. So there is an inherent problem with quality of tube manufacturing."

3.0,January,2019,negative,The proct was gud. Bt my baby not like the taste of this paste.and this tooth paste is not forming form.the chemical for making foam is absent in this paste.

3.0,July,2021,positive,Seems like good organic stuff but I think the salt makes your mouth smell after a while
3.0,May,2021,negative,Tooth paste worth paying but the tube is made poorly so the tip gets broken and leaves it open.
2.0,November,2021,positive,"It includes all good ingredients and it ha sno chemicals. But after 20 days of use, the quality of the plastic went out and there was some holes in the plastic. And the toothpaste was becoming harder to bring it out."
1.0,May,2018,neutral,"It is a grey colored paste since it contains clay. It is sweet in taste, nothing weird. But a sudden switch from a foaming toothpaste to a non-foaming one will be difficult, because more product will be needed to get that clean-teeth feel. And if you already suffer from dental conditions please stay away from this one because it made my gum inflammation worse. Or atleast check with your dentist before using this product. Oral health is really important because if you cannot eat properly, then it will affect your overall health. So, don't risk your well-being. Besides even this a chemical product and no full ingredient list is present. I do not recommend this paste for dental sufferers. I felt instead of going for chemicals, lets use ayurvedic tooth powders which are safe and economical and really strengthens the teeth and gums when used regularly. Hope this helps."

1.0,October,2018,positive,"Fluoride free is a marketing hoax. Period. I started using this toothpaste for 2 days & noticed stench on my breath along with a mild tooth ache. Fluoride is important for your teeth as it removes gems & other harmful bacteria in your mouth. Without it you're risking your dental health. There aren't enough research papers to prove fluoride free is safe & healthy for your teeth. Fluoride is dangerous only when your tap water contains above normal fluoride levels, so for most of us there isn't any requirement to go fluoride free."
