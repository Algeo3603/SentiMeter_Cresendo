3.0,November,2023,negative,"The sensodyne toothpaste has many varients. Please see before selecting, all are not good. Sensodyne Total Care is capable of curing tooth aches and also works on sensitivity issue just like they show in their adds on TV but lacs in mouth freshness. After 2-3 days consecutive use, you may feel like haven't brushed your teeth properly. So I suggest if you have tooth ache or tooth sensitivity problem, go for it but keep another toothpaste of your choise alongside for mouth freshness and use them both alternatively every 2-3 days or if you brush your teeth both the times i.e. morning- night then you may use sensodyne in night and some other one in morning."
3.0,November,2023,neutral,"Having used this product for the past 2 months, I see no difference in the sensitivity of my teeth."
3.0,June,2023,positive,"Let’s be clear. The only reason why we buy sensodyne is if we have tooth sensitivity. Yes, it is effective to a certain extent in cases where there is minor tooth sensitivity. Anything more than that would warrant a visit to the dentist for a proper intervention.That being said, the only negative of this toothpaste is the taste. It’s not bad per se but it takes getting used to. If you consider this as a medication for your teeth it’s understandable but it still needs to have a good feel in your mouth for lack of a better word. I hope they come up with better tasting toothpastes in the future."
3.0,September,2023,positive,I find it to be a good product for sensitive teeth but the only concern is its high price. Also it came with torn 'outer pack' but not going to return as the tube inside is in good condition.

1.0,May,2018,neutral,"Useless - Very Expensive- But No Results 1. The Sensitivity issue is not even a bit reduced. Total useless 2. Guys - Please note that all sensitivity is due to food particles during night , so always use floss or Inter Dental Brush and gargle using  Betadine - (Germicide gargel Rs 150 - take very little amount -- gargle -spit )  - Very effectiveDont waste money on  this kind of Toothpaste, in my opinion all Pastes are junk,  but do watch/care the cleanliness of teeth- remove tartar , do regular cleaning with Dentists,  -- Brush before bed, after bed , Massage gums and wash, Clean with water periodically in the day  (no need of paste brush)"

3.0,December,2016,positive,"#HTCI recently got this toothpaste. I don't have any problem in my teeth now. I use the general Colgate toothpaste and brush 2 times a day. so my gums are perfect. Coming to the toothpaste, this is not different from my current toothpaste, tastes little different. My mother is using it also and she got some relief from the pain for some time. so it's good for temporary relief but not a permanent solution. May give the result over a longer period(Need to use).The flavor is minty, same as my regular toothpaste. I would use the toothpaste if the price is less or some other added advantages like in taste or freshness or having some gum problem, otherwise the my regular toothpaste is enough for to maintain the regular teeth."
3.0,December,2016,negative,"#HTCRecently received this product from home tester club for  honest review.Lately I've been suffering from pain and swelling which is because  of the wisdom tooth which instead is making my teeth sensitive to anything I'm eating or drinking.I am using sensodyne sensitive toothpaste for the last one week and here is my take on it:pros:*helps in relieving the pain*prevents cavities*frothy enoughcons:*nothing different from my current toothpaste i.e colgate*didn't mention if it contains sodium lauryl sulphate which is the ingridient that cause it to froth.*doesn't removes stainOverall and affordable tooth paste ,but nothing spectacular about it which will make it stand out in the market except for the new novamin technology formula(patented)."

3.0,February,2016,negative,"The quality of this toothpaste is not same as I use to buy in the Middle East. Definitely, it is lacking the R&D touch in India.  More importantly, price of this product increased from 80 to 140 rupees which is not worth for the quantity and quality."

,on,26,neutral,"This review is similar to a previous customer review. I ordered 2 tubes. They arrived wrapped in plastic, they were not in a box.

,on,28,negative,Sensodyne products are the only tooth and mouthcare items that I use because of extremely sensitive teeth.  I had some tooth pain recently despite just getting a clean bill of health from my dentist.  I used the Rapid Relief for several days but it showed me no  relief.  At that point I decided to go back to the regular Sensodyne toothpaste and my pain from sensisensitiis gone.  This new toothpaste doesn't work as well for me.

,on,21,positive,"Would not buy it again , I’ll go back to the one from Canada it works better ."
,on,23,neutral,It did not indicate in the product that this item was manufactured  in India. I could smell the toothpaste  before I opened  the package. Also the original  description  indicated it was larger sized. Now it says 80 grams which is half the size . I thought I was getting 2 4.2 oz tubes not 2 80 gram packages.
,on,9,positive,I thought the ad was for a larger size because of the 80 gms. Lesson learned.
