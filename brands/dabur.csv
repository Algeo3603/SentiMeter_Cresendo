1.0,December,2019,negative,I have been using Dabur Red toothpaste for past three years. The toothpaste is very good and effective for dental problems. However the product I bought online from Amazon in December 2019 is substandard. It has no quality as that of local store and the flavor is very bitter. The toothpaste is appearing as if it is diluted with water. It is foaming more than the original toothpaste that we get in local store.The batches product sold online in Amazon are available at a discounted price but quality and flavor is very poor. It seems that these batches are factory rejected items.Please do not buy from Amazon. Instead buy it from local store.

1.0,March,2021,negative,"See where it is fit to be thrown!It burns the mouth seriously and creates further complications of sores too!Some reviews mentioned the burning and hence not using itSome liking it because of its burning sensationSome bearing with the burning for the first two to three months,then finding it favourite of long time,However you may choose to deal with the burning, it definitely burns and spoils the mood for the whole day and creates concern about mouth sores for a few days later, just after one use!Dabur's online report somewhere claims that everyone doesn't have the same physiology and hence toothpastes can feel differently to different people and may be even have allergic reactions to some!Well, toothpastes must suit all physiologies and if they don't, they are a health hazard and not fit to be brought to the market!The minimum legal requirement is a prominent warning about it becoming a hazard to certain types on the ads, product description and the package!In the absence of the above, see where it is fit to be thrown in!"

3.0,July,2023,negative,"I have used Dabur Red Gel it for over 4 weeks now. I have found that It does not help in removing Tarter or reducing tooth cavity. It only provides for a fresh breath (At least in my case).I appriciated the taste of it however using for prolonged periods like 5-6 minutes will lead to a strong burning & stinging sensation in the mouth and inner Lip area.If you are looking for a toothpaste to fight tooth cavity and tarter buildup on gums, this toothpaste WILL NOT do the job.If you are looking for a herbal alternative for healthy teeth, instead try Himalaya Complete Care Toothpaste or Patanjali Dantkanti Advance."

I also ordered the toothpaste from amazon in my house, but due to its taste not good and due to a couple of shortcomings, our family members have stopped using it.  And they are saying that our teeth are damaged, our gums are damaged, but I like it, but I don't like the taste, so I don't think it's very good, so I give this page and two stars."

3.0,June,2021,neutral,Flavor and freshness are not the main reasons for buying a toothpaste. It needs to be good at cleaning teeth. This paste is poorer than regular white toothpastes from good brands at removing plaque or food biofilm sticking on teeth despite producing enough foam. I think the manufacturers haven't got the combination of abrasives and foaming agents right. And the the paste contains some preservatives like sodium benzoate that are not present in many non-herbal toothpastes
3.0,April,2022,negative,The taste remains in the tongue for a very long time which is a downside for me as it makes the other flavour of the food not enjoyable.

1.0,July,2023,positive,"The only thing good about this toothpaste is its flavour. Now, the main part, the company is using cheap plastic fillings which is HARMFUL to our health in the toothpaste in the form of PVM/MA Copolymer which is a NANOPLASTICS and plastics can cause deadly diseases. Avoid this toothpaste at all costs and know which brand gives you a genuinely good toothpaste and which brands don't care about your health but only your money."

2.0,August,2021,negative,"Dabur, I blindly go towards ùsing dabur products right from hair oils to antiseptic liquids. That belief in dabur also made me choose this product. Using dabur red toothpaste in the earlier I tried this too.. the first tube was indeed awesome and we had such a good experience with fresh breath but the 2nd tube I didn't knew what went wrong, using this paste is causing mouth sores and cracked tongues.Initially I didn't notice that the mouth sores are the effect of tooth paste but later after on and off usage of the toothpaste in between made me confirm it.Even a little amount of toothpaste is having a great impact, like brushing it once only is causing numbness of taste, mouth sores, lips corners are absolutely burning, the tongue cracks are far evidentI am very disappointed that this product leashed down the hopes on the other products as well."
