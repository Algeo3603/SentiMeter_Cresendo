2.0,March,2023,negative,Received toothbrush without soft gum massager. Just cross cross bristles in the pack. Wrongly shown in Amazon that brush having rubberised gum massager bristles at left and right bristle edge.

,on,8,negative,"Just received few hours ago, normally I research my products better. This type of Oral B Glide floss is made from PTFE, and contains the highest PFAs by far for any floss. It's measured by organic Fluorine which is a marker for PFAs, coming in at about a whopping 248,000 PPM (parts per million), a massive nearly 25%. There are ongoing class law suits against this product in USA.Delving into the 1 star reviews, there are 20+ detailing toxicity of the Glide floss, including one from 2019 with over a staggering 500 likes. Obviously it appears it should be pulled, and this is probably fairly imminent. In my opinion I can't see how anybody would knowingly put this in their mouths."
,on,15,negative,I have about every other dispensers where the floss knots up and breaks. It is so frustrating that I just throw the defective ones away. I think they have some serious quality issues
,on,12,neutral,"No issues with the floss itself, but it was shipped as is (no shipping box or packaging). Luckily no damage to the product itself."
,on,3,negative,"UPDATE: The durability of this product is mediocre at best. One night I broke it off 5 times in a row without trying. Did I just hit the weight room and not know my own strength? Did I just take my vitamins, whey protein and other fitness related supplements so I was 'arm wrestling' the floss? No again. About every 4th or 5th time I use this floss it snaps after I peel off a 16"" piece of rope and give it a go. This is not a compelling argument for leaving the old skool floss in the dust and transitioning to this new skool floss when the durability is this mediocre. I will sniff around for another manufacturer or model type of the flat style floss since I do need to use this style of floss per my perio. At this price point, I expected better.My periodontist advised me that due to my tight spacing between teeth (their is a term for this but it escapes me) and my current gum issues I should move to a FLAT type floss like Glide.I am having some gum issues and my new perio said that there is very little space between my teeth and due to the tight spacing I should go with a flat and wide floss like Glide or others. She says otherwise I will continue cutting into my gums which will lead to problems if it continues.I wish the flavor was WINTERGREEN (my fave), but at least it is flavored. It is a WIDE floss but it seems others I have tried keep their shape better during the flossing. I could be remembering wrong but that seems to be the case. This goes between my tight teeth easily. One thing to avoid is cutting off anything less than 18"" or IMHO the odds of you breaking it increases exponentially. You need a nice loose grip and you want the floss inserted more loosely versus having it as tight as a string on a violin. This helps you avoid breaking it and having to trash it. This quality floss isn't cheap so I don't want to waste it if I can help it.I like the silver container since I am a visual person and I like when things that are out in plain view go with our modern condo's appearance."
,on,11,positive,"Based on this article, I'm concerned about the safety of using this product.  I would appreciate a credit for this purchase.  If warranted, lyou may want to consider pulling this item.  Thanks in advance for any help you can provideYour dental floss might be exposing you to toxic chemicalsAFP Relax News•January 09, 2019Flossing your teeth with certain types of floss could expose you to higher levels of toxic chemicals according to new research.MoreNew US research has found that flossing your teeth -- and certain other behaviors -- may increase exposure to the toxic chemicals linked with a variety of health problems.Led by Silent Spring Institute in collaboration with the Public Health Institute in Berkeley, the new study looked at blood samples taken from 178 middle-aged women to measure the levels of 11 different PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) chemicals in the body.The women, half of whom were non-Hispanic-white and the other half African-American, were also interviewed about nine behaviors that could potentially also lead to higher exposures.The findings, published in the Journal of Exposure Science & Environmental Epidemiology (JESEE), showed that women who flossed their teeth tended to have higher levels of a type of PFAS called PFHxS (perfluorohexanesulfonic acid) in their body compared with those who didn't, in particular when flossing with Oral-B Glide, one of 18 flosses included in the study.In addition, all three of the Oral B Glide products included, plus three store brands, also tested positive for fluorine -- a marker of PFAS -- a finding also in line with previous reports that Glide is made using Teflon-like compounds.The researchers also found that having stain-resistant carpet or furniture and living in a city with PFAS-contaminated drinking water supply were also behaviors linked to higher PFAS levels.Among the African-American participants, those who frequently ate pre-prepared food that came in coated cardboard containers, such as French fries or takeout, also had elevated blood levels of four PFAS chemicals compared to women who rarely ate this type of food. However, the same relationship was not found among non-Hispanic whites, although the researchers are unable to explain why.PFAS are water- and grease-proof substances that are used in a wide a range of consumer products, including fast food packaging, non-stick pans, waterproof clothing and stain-resistant carpets.They have been linked with numerous health problems, including kidney and testicular cancer, thyroid disease, high cholesterol, low birth weight, decreased fertility, and effects on the immune system. Exposure to the chemicals occurs through using products which contain PFAS, eating food that has been in contact with these products, exposure to indoor air and dust, and through drinking contaminated drinking water.""This is the first study to show that using dental floss containing PFAS is associated with a higher body burden of these toxic chemicals,"" says lead author Katie Boronow, ""The good news is, based on our findings, consumers can choose flosses that don't contain PFAS.""""Overall, this study strengthens the evidence that consumer products are an important source of PFAS exposure,"" adds Boronow. ""Restricting these chemicals from products should be a priority to reduce levels in people's bodies."""
,on,19,negative,"Weirdly, the mint flavor floss breaks every other time I use it. The original unflavored version does NOT. Something in the flavoring must be weakening the floss. Don't buy this, buy the original unflavorded version (white packaging)."
,on,13,positive,"I was surprised to find out that it's not a typical floss string, but actually a thing plastic band. Feels weird using it and I don't think it does the job as well as a classic string"
,on,21,positive,I love the feel of this floss. It's smooth as can be and super comfortable to use. The only problem is that it breaks if you hold it to taughtly while using it.
,on,21,positive,This stuff used to be stronger but now breaks frequently so need 2-3x more floss each use.
,on,13,negative,"I urge you to prove it to yourself by phoning the 800 number on the package. I did. It took me 1/2 hour to get a straight talking supervisor to verify for me that Oral-B has hidden a “forever chemical” in their dental floss.Forever chemicals are carcinogens made of fluoride and carbon bonded together so strongly that they will never break down in nature. And 90 to 99% of all humans have these chemicals in their bloodstream. These chemicals are in Teflon frying pans, fire proof pajamas, and foam fire extinguishers.Isn’t it bad enough that unscrupulous companies have been polluting our ground water and air with these toxins for 70 years. Do the powers that be really need to also put them in our dental floss, too? a product that is meant to be put into our mouths and that therefore can come into direct contact with our bleeding gums?Well, Oral-B thinks so. That’s why they call it Oral-B GLIDE floss. Like with Teflon frying pans it doesn’t stick but glides between your teeth. It’s like you’ve got a Teflon frying pan rubbing against your bleeding gums. Disgusting! They should be sued.Here’s the particular version of these fluoride-carbon forever chemicals that Oral-B impregnates its Pro GLIDE floss with… wait for it… I had the supervisor spell it out for me:POLYTETRAFLURCTHYLBNE (or EPTTE for short.)Don’t use this floss. I’m throwing mine out and hope to join a class-action lawsuit against Oral-B to punish them for such blatant malfeasance."
,on,15,negative,"The floss is a pretty wide ribbon, I don't think it digs out debris very well. But the worst thing is that it breaks easily. My teeth slice it right in two, and I frequently have to use more than one piece to get the job done."
,on,26,negative,"I bought these because I've done other toiletry like products (e.g., shaving cream, toothpaste, etc.) in bulk and the value/quality is usually pretty good.  The risk is that you get six of something that isn't very good.  I'm not sure whether this floss has been sitting in a warehouse for a few years or what, but I probably have to go back and get a new strand three to four times to complete one session.  The floss has a tendency to break very easily.  I've bought the same floss at the grocery store or gotten it from the dentist with no problems whatsoever, so not sure why this specific batch is problematic."
,on,27,negative,"Have used samples from my dentist and liked the product.  Not sure if these are a bad batch or Chinese knock off, but they break very easily.  I would say i break once or twice every other use, a bit of an aggravation for sure..."
,on,16,negative,I was a loyal customer using this floss for years only to discover today that it contains PFAS. These are highly slippery and highly toxic chemicals commonly used in non-stick products that have been linked to all sorts of cancers and other health problems.There is absolutely not need for these consumer products to be in dental floss. I'm throwing away this product and never using it again! You should too if you care about your health.
,on,17,negative,"As the title states, this floss and many in Oral-B's Glide line contain PFAS. Not only is it absolutely deplorable to be producing products that make its way into our ecosystem, but to put it in a product used in our mouths, and without disclosing it?! Not sure how this is legal in any way but as a user of this floss for over 4 years I am disgusted by Oral B and P&G for exposing us to this while knowing the risk involved.Instead of taking a random internet reviewers word for it, please Google it. There are studies that talk about PFAS in floss, in particular this floss and referenced in the journal Nature and Harvard.Tossing the rest I have left in the trash... Shame on you Oral B"
,on,27,negative,Product is amazing however the packaging holding the floss is absolutely awful.  The design is wrong and the floss keeps coming out of the plastic holding case.  I got a pack of Sox and happened to all of them.  It really is an AMAZING floss.  Wish they re did the case
,on,15,negative,"I like glide overall … like how smooth it is andHow it glides between the teeth,  But this stuff seems to either shred or tear or rip in half way too frequently and it’s just kind of annoying."
,on,2,negative,I have never had such terrible experience with an Oral-B Guide Pro-Health dental floss product before.These are SO flimsy that I end up using 15-20 pieces (again and again) just to get my flossing done because they tear up as soon as I put it in my mouth.I've been flossing for 20 years now (and I'm not an alligator) so this is not related to not using this product right. It just has extremely poor quality. Would not recommend it.
,on,16,negative,"Quality control needs to be addressed. My last shipment of 6 floss in March 2022 was so poor that I had to throw out half of them. The floss shredded and the mechanism to keep the spool of floss inside the compartment detached and made the floss unusable. The only resort I briefly used was to cut the floss with scissors. I gave up on that after a short while. The garbage bin was the ticket.I had used this floss a good deal in the past and thought it was good. However, whoever produced this last shipment didn't know what they were doing."
,on,6,negative,"This product is no better than the Amazon basics version, but is far more expensive. I suspect that both are made by the same Chinese factory."
,on,12,neutral,I cannot find a expiration date either on the front or the back side of the product.
,on,17,negative,"Disappointing. I’ve used this brand before, but this version is flimsy and breaks easily. This means I end up using three or four times as much as I normally do.  Time to try a different brand."
,on,21,positive,"I was recommended this because its good for tight spaces between teeth and it is, but the problem is that they rip too easily! Still good but have to be very gentle when using."
,on,29,negative,"The package was opened at the top when it arrived and immediately noticed how cheap the dental floss casing and sloppy the label and logo was. Some cases the floss was not wound properly.I didn’t feel comfortable using it, because there is no protective seal on any of the individual packets.Randomly I took out a piece and ran it across my finger to see if it could have been tampered with and a white powered came off. I tried a few other strands from the other cases and no residue came off.As an avid Forensic Files binge-watcher, I immediately suspected it was fentanyl. Considering that I don’t have lab in my home to test the substance, I of course threw it out and washed my hand vigorously.Will not reorder and would not recommend using if the package is opened."
,on,20,negative,"Depending on your teeth spacing, it's difficult to find a floss which does the job without shredding or getting stuck between the teeth.  This one (Glide Oral B Pro Health) didn't work for me)"
,on,10,positive,"My dentist gave me a sampler of this floss and since I used it, I can't go back to regular, so I ordered these. Compared to the sample, i'm quite disappointed to have found that this floss starts peeling and breaking apart during use. My teeth are close together and I do apply a bit of force that all other flosses have survived. So for the price, it's a shame because it's so easy to use, smells and tastes nice, but BREAKS. I love it and want it to be perfect like the dentist sample...!"
,on,5,negative,Bought this because I thought it wouldn't shred. It shreds more than other floss I've tried. Very disappointed.
,on,5,negative,"I always bought this brand of dental floss from my grocery store and had zero issues.I buy it here on Amazon due to the value of the 6 pack, but the quality is noticeably worse. While flossing, almost every time this floss will snap in half with the slightest pressure applied. Never happened before. Not the first time I bought something from Amazon where the quality just isn't the same as the exact same product from a local store."
,on,23,negative,"I have used and liked Glide for many years.  This is the first I have purchased the multi-pack . . . always used to buy individual rolls at the grocery store.  I might have gotten a ""bad"" pack, but I have now tried 3 different rolls, and all have been far inferior in quality to the Glide I am used to.  It breaks and shreds very easily . . . a problem I never had with Glide in the past.  I will go back to buying single rolls at the store."
,on,11,negative,What am I going to do with this mess
,on,3,positive,Everything is fine except it breaks easily. I’ve never had this problem before this floss.
,on,20,negative,"The floss is coated in a toxic nonstick chemical (Study published in Nature dated 1/8/19). They have done studies to prove women who use Glide Oral B floss have higher levels of PFAs in their blood. PFAs are proven to cause high cholesterol, developmental delays in kids, changes to your immune system, thyroid problems and more. They should never be used on food products. That’s why all the nonstick skillets are now advertising no PFAs. I’m furious. I’m breastfeeding and they have proven this gets transferred in breast milk. These chemicals are banned in CA."
,on,12,negative,We used to buy bulk of these at the warehouse club...and its always around this price. Not the cheapest floss out there definitely but ive used several non -Glide ones and they are a PAIN. Shreds of the floss get stuck to your mouth on those cheap floss. Really wish they are cheaper alternatives out there. For now these are the only ones me and my family use.
,on,28,negative,"I have ordered this three times in the last year. The last order, the first two I used broke early on. The plastic case wouldn't close, the the metal pice fell off, and it was extremely frustrating to try to use the rest of the floss. I would have thought it was a fluke, but, the second one had same problem. Too bad, as I really like the floss."
,on,1,negative,"The box broken at the very first time use, poor quality."
,on,24,negative,"We’re the kind of family who switched from nonstick pans to stainless steel to avoid the toxic coatings. Had no idea we were literally rubbing those same coatings in our mouths with this stupid oral-b glide floss. Why is this even legal/on the market? What kind of evil person work think it’s a good idea to poison their customers like this? I know it won’t make a difference to them, but personally I’m never buying ANY oral-B product again. I feel completely betrayed by the brand."
,on,19,negative,"Whenever I use this floss I can't help but remember the reviews that brought to my attention (too late) the dangerous chemicals, which I later looked into and confirmed, but on top of that the floss literally smells like I didn't wash my hands after using torn single ply... no no no no no... it stinks, badly."
,on,2,negative,"I like the floss itself and have been buying it for years but no longer. The last 7-8 dispensers all had spooling problems--the floss would come off the spool, snag, or even split into 2 strands. With every one I had to remove the spool and finish it by using scissors. There is a serious defect with this product. And it isn't cheap!"
,on,13,neutral,The store bought ones don’t fall apart on me.
,on,22,negative,"How pathetic—counterfeit floss. Really? Each and every one of the six flosses in this package fell apart—“floss” material is weak, snags, frays, and eventually the entire plastic container falls open and the “floss” unravels. I’d love to be able to return it if I could but I’ve already almost gone through the whole package after tossing the broken ones and attempting to work with what I’ve got when I’m rushing to get ready in the mornings. This product is not the real Glide floss; if you’ve had the misfortune of ordering this pathetic knockoff do yourself a favor and just pick up the legit floss at a CVS or wherever. The difference in quality is might and day. I don’t plan to use the rest of what I have left because it is truly that worthless. I won’t be ordering dental floss ever again from amazon, and this is not the first time I’ve received a counterfeit product from amazon."
,on,28,negative,The floss itself smells and tastes like a terrible chemical. It's totally different than the same floss I usually buy at Walmart.
,on,15,negative,"Have tried different ways to avoid tearing - no way to avoid. May be fine if sufficient gaps between teeth as to slide in between easily down to gum. But if must use force to get floss down between teeth touching at top, no good - and have similar experience at times, when tear off length of floss from container.Just bought J & J reach - single tough strand as oppose to intertwined, ribbon-type strand - much better for my situation. Slide down without any tearing and thus can do more effective job cleaning gum between teeth"
,on,26,positive,"This floss is the best, and I’ve ordered it from Amazon several times.  But this time the seller — “The Chosen Shop” in Fresno, CA, sent me a different kind of Oral B floss.  I have to go through the effort of returning it."
,on,3,positive,"I was a big fan of the old Oral-B Complete Satin floss . Unfortunately, the new/updated floss has a thinner string which isn't nearly as durable or as good at getting funk out between your teeth. Will not be buying this model again."
,on,23,neutral,Have been using this product for years with no issues. First time buying bulk pack on Amazon and most of the packs were defective. The string would either get tangled or split into two. Half of it ended up in the trash. Seems like they stick the lower-quality ones in the bulk packs.
,on,9,neutral,"I have never had an issue with floss before - it’s a pretty straight-forward transaction. But this floss breaks almost every time I use it. Floss, you had one job! And you failed."
,on,26,neutral,This floss breaks easily. Regular Oral-B floss does not.  Had similar issues with Oral-B floss from Costco. Waste so much floss due to it breaking during flossing. Sticking with the regular Oral-B floss.
,on,15,negative,"when i use the floss with normal force, there is a decent chance that the box break down or the string get clogged. so disappointing"
,on,15,negative,"For 20 years I used Oral B dental floss. It was familiar so I kept using it. Over time, it began breaking more and more often as I was flossing. I think they were using cheaper and cheaper material over time. I switched to a different floss and my teeth are much healthier. I don’t like companies that use their brand recognition to sell customers an inferior product.  Maybe they think we’re dumb?"
,on,8,negative,What can you do when you are unable to get to a store. I was quite shocked to see these tiny flosses...and for $20 ridiculous!!! Never again.
,on,11,positive,Breaks easily.
,on,2,negative,"I think there are many questions out there regarding the ingredients of this product and if it could be toxic.  I believe that it is necessary that this manufacturer show their ingredients and either declare that it is PFAS free or that if it has any similar ingredients that are toxic then declare this.  It is clear from the research how dangerous these chemicals are and the movie Dark Waters is worth watching which explains this.  Since there are no ingredients shown and no declaration that this product is free from these types of materials I will no longer be purchasing.  Toxic to body, toxic to environment...who knows but until I know I am done purchasing."
,on,26,negative,"I don’t mind the floss itself but the mint flavor gets on your hands, lips, and the corners of your mouth.  I don’t like it at all. Not sure how I ended up with the mint version but it’s nasty and annoying."
,on,29,negative,"What happened to Glide?? My teeth are very close together and Glide was wonderful when it first came out. Now, the floss and the container seem to be much cheaper. Floss separates, breaks easily. Container breaks or I have to open it up to get the floss out. After struggling with multiple containers and lots of broken floss I am switching brands. Very disappointing."
,on,20,negative,It's advertised in the picture to be the white floss but comes in as the gray floss and it rips apart in between my teeth during use. so frustrating.
,on,6,negative,The case that houses the floss is flimsy and keeps coming apart
,on,30,negative,I like Oral-B products but this one just doesn't hold up. I'm an avid flosser and this used to be much stronger. Will be looking for a replacement floss that doesn't get stuck in your teeth and doesn't break so easily.
,on,11,negative,"I don't know how you screw up dental floss, but this stuff is absolutely terrible. I have to go through about three or four full strands every time I floss, because they are constantly breaking. If you have tight contacts between your teeth (or sharp teeth?)...then don't waste your time and money on this crap. It's how I would imagine trying to floss your teeth with teflon pipe tape might feel. I suppose it's possible that this is a counterfeit version...not sure why amazon has such a problem with fake dental health products. Guess I'll be shopping at target next time around..."
,on,19,negative,It's floss. It works. But I was surprised at how minty it is. Shockingly so. Warning- Do Not touch your eyes after using this. Mint is strong and it gets on your hands from flossing. I've not noticed this with other brands of mint floss previously. I will not buy flavored floss again after this experience. Now I wish I didn't have 6 boxes to use up.
,on,21,positive,Breaks Way too easily. You're lucky to get one floss out of it without it tearing in half and having to use more.
,on,24,positive,I had been very happy with for years.  But it seems to me that Oral B has maybe cut corners on quality because the last batch that I had would not get through a run through my teeth without breaking.
,on,26,positive,I would like it more if the floss box stayed together
,on,19,positive,This floss is too thick to my tight teeth. It looks much thicker than the picture but the mint smell is good. I'm buying it for flossing not for the flavor. I may send them back.
,on,21,negative,"I'm not sure if they have reduced the amount of material in the floss or what has changed, but this floss is now unusable for me. The slightest snag and the floss snaps. Also shreds much more easily than in the past. Recommend going to a different brand."
,on,25,negative,"The flavor is nice, but this dental floss breaks so easily that you end up using two or three times as much dental floss as you should be using.  It is frustrating to begin flossing and have the piece of floss break and then have to continue the process with a new piece of floss.  At times I have had to use three pieces in a single flossing.  I would never buy this product again."
,on,28,positive,Breaks too easily but otherwise OK
,on,13,positive,"I wanted to love this floss tape because I have been always so pleased with Oral B products. However, when I opened the packaging, the smell of mint filled the room and was overpowering. I love the smell of mint, but the scent of this tape caused my eyes to water and made me cough."
,on,18,positive,"Floss is ok, but breaks very easily with very little pressure applied"
,on,17,negative,"According to a news posting on the Medscape website today (1/17/2019):""Flossing teeth could increase the body's levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) — widely used chemicals linked to a number of diseases and certain cancers — warn US researchers.""""Oral-B Glide and five competitor flosses contained detectable fluorine (including three branded as Glide and two with labels inviting customers to compare the products with Oral-B Glide).""Specifically, flossing with Oral-B Glide was associated with 24.9% higher median levels of PFHxS.""Note: Medscape is a website designed primarily for doctors and health researchers."
,on,19,negative,Takes me around 3 peices to floss teeth as the floss keeps breaking. Very annoying. I will not buy again.
,on,18,negative,"Not what I expected, the floss breaks easily. Also the floss is really big"
,on,6,negative,"This isn't like the old floss, that came in more rugged, durable, darker grey containers.  The cutter falls out, or just trying to cut floss now is a chore. Horrible new design."
,on,9,negative,The plastic housing will pop open everytime I try to pull floss out. Not very good.
,on,10,negative,This floss was okay but my boxes all had trouble dispensing floss. It was like the floss was all folded in half in the package because as I try to use it it’s not flat. It’s a thin line like fishing line. Won’t repurchase.
,on,17,neutral,"This is not the floss to use if you have very tight teeth.  I bought this based on reviews. My teeth are very close together, and the floss always tears. I end up using double the amount of floss."
,on,21,positive,Flimsy outer casing. Keeps popping open
,on,5,negative,There's something off about the design of the housing. The floss slips around and becomes difficult to draw out and cut. If you find a good way around this (such as getting it tucked in where it's supposed to be and then carefully holding a finger over it to keep it from slipping) then this floss works pretty much as well as any other.
,on,16,negative,"I just found out that Oral-B Glide contains one of the highest PFAS (a poison) levels of all floss brands. Why Amazon is still selling it, let alone why it's still being manufactured, is beyond me. Minimally not posting a warning is false advertising."
,on,16,negative,I purchase this brand from my drugstore but this obviously is not the same company.  Each dental floss had something wrong with it so I ended throwing the entire package out.
,on,6,negative,"I bought a six pack some time ago and occasionally had the floss shred or fall apart, but the packet I'm using now, is not usable, falls apart!  I have used three of the original 6 pack, with some difficulty, but this is no good at all, in fact dangerous!!  Buy some other brand!"
,on,5,negative,I am using a TON of this because the floss snaps everytime I use it.I won't be buying this again.
,on,6,negative,Works ok but they break easily. I was expecting a better quality product because of the brand and because it is sold by Amazon. I thought Amazon would ensure that the products that they sell directly vs third-party sellers were high quality because their reputation is at stake. Disappointed.
,on,11,negative,"While I like the Glide products, this one was a mistake. The floss is very fragile and breaks easily when using. I have never had this happen before and was quite shocked when it did. Won’t be purchasing this again."
,on,14,negative,"It does what it's supposed to do, plus more. What's the more, you ask? exposure to PFAS! Unless you like putting chemicals in your mouth, use another product. I wouldn't have bought this if I knew what it contained."
,on,3,negative,I thought they wont break but they actually do maybe not for me
,on,24,neutral,"Compared to the original Glide floss (in the white package), this floss breaks easily when challenged by a sharp tooth or a tight space.  It probably works fine for many people, but not me."
,on,14,negative,"This is the absolute worst floss I've ever used. As someone who's been flossing for 32 years, and never had an issue with any of the brands I've used thus far, I can safely say this floss is basically unusable. I've opened 4 different sets of this floss and each one breaks within 3-4 teeth. I typically use three or four separate strings of this floss every time I need to floss my teeth. I'll be going with the regular brand instead of this one. Stay away."
,on,16,negative,I had the previous purchase of this in front of me when I placed my reorder...I do not think that the thread is the same and does not appear to clean as well. Not awful just not the same...darn.
,on,17,negative,"This is a fake version of what you can buy in brick stores. It will work for the first couple of feet and then gets to weak parts of the spool that break easily. Every unit in the pack is like that. I bought it twice, thinking it was a fluke, same thing happened again."
,on,23,positive,Glide used to be awesome when Gore and later Crest sold it but this stuff just breaks too easy. It shreds too easy and gets tangled up inside the container. And last few orders the containers just fall apart too during normal use. How much worse can it get?
,on,6,positive,Shreds in 3 pieces every time I use it. Wtf. My Kroger floss holds up better than this
,on,23,negative,The floss works about 70% of the time but 30% of the time it breaks while flossing. Not good quality floss.
,on,21,positive,"This dental floss seems to function well in flossing, however, Oral-B Glide has high levels of organic fluorine.  (Re)search PFAS and dental floss.  Or, on amazon ""floss without pfas""."
,on,1,negative,This company is being sued for failing to disclose harmful chemicals in this product. I want a refund immediately.
,on,18,positive,Breaks easily
,on,27,negative,This stuff breaks very easily...the real Glide does not!I'm not sure where or how this seller got this Glide but it must have been rejected by the original manufacturer!
,on,26,negative,"I bought the 6-pack from Amazon because my local pharmacy did not have the Glide.  There must have been a manufacturing defect because I had a problem with all but 1 of the 6 packages.  They would work fine initially, but when you got about half-way through the package, the floss would shred and separate as it came out of the package.  To correct the problem I had to open up the package and realign the floss on the guides. It would then work for a while and start to shred again."
,on,29,negative,"I didn't realize this was ""deep clean"" vs the original floss. Not happy with it at all. It is thicker and is irritating my gums."
,on,3,negative,"This was worse purchase I ever made from Amazon. I don’t know where this was made and packaged but it was a very poor product. Normally I would not order this item from Amazon but because of COVID 19, I did. The floss shredded every time I tried to floss my teeth. The shredded material stuck between my teeth. Now I have 6 packages of it because I’d didn’t start using it until after return date. Never again."
,on,24,negative,Seemed to be a low quality production run...
3.0,October,2022,positive,Good product but difficult to use. I feel floss sticke are easier than this thread. As it's expensive I am using it with some difficulty.
3.0,April,2022,negative,"The product was wrapped in a plastic cover, but after removing the cover, it looks like someone opened it and did not even close it again. How could this happen? Must be sealed as a health product."
1.0,July,2023,negative,The thread got stuck inside and it's not rolling out I need to open the floss box every time and use it. It's not worth it for this high price.
2.0,July,2022,positive,
3.0,July,2022,positive,Good floss. Better than the normal super thin flosses but not as good as expandable floss.
,on,6,neutral,"I prefer another version they do. This 1 I bought by accident, its OK but it rolls up and shreds. It is very soft and light so in some ways it's OK but just not to my taste. Although the mintyness is ok too."
,on,13,negative,"May have been the wrong choice for me, but the level of flatness impacted my flossing a bit more than the string options.Otherwise okay"
,on,28,negative,"Lid and cutting device a bit awkward to get the hang of, but once mastered was fine.  Handy being in a bigger size."
,on,22,neutral,"This isn't like the floss I had before. It's rather weird. I didn't know if I was supposed to clean my teeth with it or use to correct something I'd written on a piece of paper. The minty taste is nothing more than a concept. I mean, it didn't break. It did stick to my fingers when I tried to drop it in the bin. Preferred the old stuff."
,on,10,negative,The container for the floss broke very quickly after little use
,January,2024,positive,"Il prodotto di per sé è buono ma per due volte mi è arrivato il filo lungo solo 25 metri (scritto sulla confezione)mentre nella descrizione c’è scritto 40, ho segnalato il problema ma nel nuovo ordine mi è arrivato lo stesso (25 metri)."
,on,11,positive,
,on,13,neutral,"I know it's just floss but I don't expect to get something out of date via Amazon. Printed date is 07/23 and I ordered in 12/23.Additionally just for anyone who cares between the difference this is technical dental tape, the thicker stuff, not pin-thin dental floss.If you don't mind the above two issues this is fine and I will use it, but it's not what I was expecting from the description."
,November,2023,negative,"Aufgrund einer Empfehlung meines Zahnarztes habe ich die Oral B Pro Expert Premium Zahnseide gesucht. Ich habe diesen Artikel bestellt und gedacht das richtige Produkt gefunden zu haben. Es wurden 25 m Clinic Line Zahnseide geliefert, statt 40 m Premium. Ich habe danach googelt und keinen Treffer zu dieser Produktserie gedunden.Desweiteren ist der Aufdruck auf dem eigentlichen Behälter etwas verschwommen, was beim Produkt im Zahnarztzimmer nicht der Fall war. Beim Logo auf dem Behälter und auf der Papierverpackung fehlt das R.Das finde ich seltsam, auch wenn ein Produktionsdatum =4/22 und die Nummer (seriennummer?) 2098652650 drauf gedruckt sind.Im Übrigen fasert die Zahnseide."
,on,27,negative,Can't say how good our not the actual product is as the packaging was already broken on arrival and the product was out of date by six months.
,on,23,positive,"The floss itself is really good - pleasant taste, not sharp feeling if it hits your gum. The dispenser is fiddly and awkward though. The tape kept slipping off the reel and jamming it up. When I opened up the case it was really fiddly to sort out. This has never been a problem with other brands. It doesn't seem like it should be rocket science to make a reel that doesn't jam up."
,on,27,positive,Out of date product being sold 4 months over sell by date
,on,10,negative,"This ""floss"" is more like a tape than I'm used to, also the container it's in is rubbish and just falls apart everytime you pull the floss though."
,on,8,negative,"Delivered without its original packaging, don’t know if it’s already been used. Do not recommend"
,on,25,negative,Unsealed product packaging and out of date
,on,10,negative,"Thought we would try Oral B instead of Glide, which we normally have. We must say that we were not really impressed at all with it. The container the floss comes in is not so robust as the Glide and the floss is mounted on the opposite side to the Glide and these two things together, we felt, made things frustrating to pull the Oral B from its dispenser. The floss itself seemed fine it was just the dispensing container that wasn't up to the job. So we won't be ordering again and will stick to Glide."
,on,20,positive,Ordered this in December 2023 and it's out of date.
,on,13,negative,Unfortunately I had to throw the floss away as the packaging had been opened. I wasn't comfortable putting something in my mouth thats been tampered with
,on,4,negative,I've been attaching the flosser to a reusable floss handle.  It's a very weak floss line.  I probably get about two goes over my teeth before the line breaks.  Quite poor considering the price.  Can barely taste the mint or whatever flavour it's supposed to be. Overpriced and poor quality floss line.
,on,8,positive,Went out of date in July 2023. It's now Dec 2023.
,on,22,negative,"I was really surprised how poor the plastic container is for an Oral-B product until I took the floss reel out and fixed it back in, the floss doesn’t pull out easily and the container just falls apart, hence taking the floss off it’s peg inside helped it pull much better but the container is still loose, hence my 3 stars."
,on,23,positive,
,on,12,negative,"Can't trust an already opened package, threw it straight in the bin."
,November,2023,positive,Filo interdentale che sembra fatto di teflon appiccicoso! Sconsigliato!
,on,25,positive,"It's OK. It's more like a tape, or ribbon kind of thing, instead of a round thread. It's very thin and glides well, but also easy to cut and hurt gums. It cleans, but not as well as really thin round threads. A good thing is that it's very resistant."
,on,2,negative,"Product has a very frail plastic covering. Everytime I try to pull floss for use, the thread is stuck and the cover opens up. Overall, happy with the floss thread but extremely unhappy with the outer covering. It's really frustrating."
,September,2023,negative,La descrizione dice che l'articolo in vendita è 40 metri ma realmente è da 25 metri avendone acquistati 2 ne mancano 30 metri
,on,21,positive,"I love the taste, I love the smell, I love that it's a bit thicker than usual floss and seems to get more out from between teeth. I don't like that the floss rips apart every other time I put it between my teeth, it makes flossing take twice as long as it normally would, and I get through three times the amount of floss I normally would. I won't buy this floss again because the constant ripping in half makes it frustrating to use."
,on,11,negative,Bought this as an alternative to the Oral B satin tape - it's okay. The taste is fine but the texture is very rubbery.
,on,4,positive,"It does a good job and tastes nice, but the pack/box is really flimsy and the floss keeps sliding down the side. You then need to open it up and find the end of the floss again - pretty annoying!"
,on,23,positive,"Its ok, has a nice minty smell. Sometimes the string slips out of my fingers and can be hard to to use on the further away teeth."
,on,18,neutral,"sorry, I don't like this kind of material of Dental Floss, it cannot clean well. but it is better than the blue one"
,on,28,neutral,"It snaps very easily, doesn’t feel like it is strong enough for the job. Surprised as usually expect better from Oral B. It’s a nice size tape that slides easily between teeth and minty taste very slight"
,July,2022,positive,
,on,6,negative,Get dry after 2 days.Not worth a penny.
,July,2019,negative,"Den Bewertungen zu urteilen, hätte ich mehr erwartet. Die Zahnseide macht die Zahnzwischenräume zwar schön sauber, aber das kann die nornale Oral B Essentialfloss auch. Ebenso der Frischegeschmack ist sehr gut, da er nicht so aufdringlich ist.Soweit wäre alles gut, wenn die Zahnseide nur nicht leicht reissen würde. Dieses ist mir schon mehrmals passiert, gerade wenn man im hinteren Bereich die Zahnseide spannen muss, um dort die Zwischenräume zu säubern. Ich habe ziemlich enge Zahnzschwischenräume.Ich werde sie trotzdem wieder kaufen, da ich für mich keine Alternative in Frage kommt. Die Essentialfloss ribbelt sich gerne auf, dies ist viel nerviger, weil dann u.U. winzig dünne Fäden zwischen den Zähnen verbleiben."
,on,6,negative,I’ve used this product for a long time but from the outset this one was stiff to pull the floss through and completely fell apart. Still useable but it’s annoying having to pull floss through twice a day.
,on,12,positive,"The packaging of the product has already been opened, this product is hygienic and its packaging must be correct"
,on,27,negative,"I thought using oral B it would be a safe bet, but it just snaps when using it. Not impressed and won't buy again."
,April,2021,negative,il filo è resistente e il meccanismo di strappo è abbastanza comodo. Però dopo pochi usi l'involucro si è deformato e risulta complicato strappare il filo. Forse il costo è eccessivo per la qualità generale del prodotto (anche se il filo è abbastanza buono).
,on,21,negative,"This is tape not floss!  I hate tape as it doesn't clean between teeth as well so I avoid it wherever possible, but the pack says ""floss"" and the image looks like floss but it is flat tape.  Also, the package was completely in bits so I can't even be sure of how hygienic it is!!"
,on,23,negative,The floss itself is off poor quality and breaks easily and it's slipped out of the casing so now it's difficult to cut a section off.. wouldn't buy this again.
,on,7,negative,The pack stays open like this. It looks faulty. Very unhygienic and annoying
,September,2021,negative,Ho comprato questo filo interdentale perché non si incastra tra i denti e ha un buon sapore.Ma la confezione arrivata sembrava aperta e  reincollata.Oral b e tutti i produttori  di prodotti per l'igiene personale dovrebbero rivedere le confezioni rendendole ecologiche e garantendone l'integrità con un sigillo di garanzia. Amazon permette il reso di prodotti per l'igiene cosa contrariamente a quanto afferma nella sua politica resi. Dovrebbe invece garantire la sicurezza di questi prodotti.
,on,5,negative,"It took out my crown, and is way too thick to fit between teeth. It gets stuck and has a weird faint mint taste. If you have big gaps in your teeth go for it!"
,on,2,neutral,"Alright, does the job. Not a particular fan of the flavour."
,January,2021,neutral,Il prodotto mi è piaciuto però quello che è arrivato a me non c'è scritto floss e comunque quello che mi è arrivato si trova a prezzi molto più bassi. Io l'avevo comprato perché volevo quello floss
,July,2021,negative,"Il filo è ottimo, peccato per la il contenitore che non permette il fluido scorrimento del filo."
,June,2021,negative,Arrivato in tempi giusti. Il prezzo non male. Essendo un po’ più doppio il filo fa un po’ male nell’ utilizzo. Gusto menta
,May,2021,positive,"per quanto sia efficace e di qualità, penso che abbia un prezzo un po elevato."
,April,2020,negative,"La consegna arrivata il giorno prima del previsto. Il filo ha una forma più larga, ma si infila in maniera delicata tra i denti, anche i più stretti. Bisogna utilizzarlo per un po' di tempo al fine di una buona pulizia, perché il filo è delicato e non molto incisivo."
,December,2019,negative,"Dalla descrizione pensavo fosse simile al dental floss (ritirato dal commercio per sospetti problemi di tossicità), invece sembra quasi di ... teflon. Pertanto tranne il sapore fresco, non rimuove a mia sensazione la placca. Non è abbastanza ""ruvido"" come ci si aspetta da un filo interdentale efficace. Deluso"
,on,24,negative,Not worth the price for something that doesn't really clean between your teeth.  The surface of the floss is too smooth and doesn't remove plaque. Would not recommend.
,on,17,negative,I found the floss ro be too thick. So was painful using on my teeth.
,on,5,positive,I purchased this as I expected good things from oral B. You also got a lot of length for your money.The flavour was nice and minty which is very pleasant to use in the mouth.Unfortunately the floss was quite weak and tore in several places when I was using it.
,March,2022,positive,"Gute Zahnseide, jedoch zu teuer."
,on,24,positive,
,September,2020,positive,Il filo interdentale è buono essendo OralB ma non corrisponde a quello della descrizione e foto. Andrebbe corretto per non trarre in inganno.
,on,10,positive,"You put it in your mouth, grind it between your teeth, and make the old foods come out from between. This one does the bleeding less. That's good, right? Does not come with dancing instructions though. 1 star."
,on,12,positive,Thrown away
,on,25,positive,Difficult to use
,on,1,negative,It was broken when It arrived.
,on,16,negative,Thought this would be the thin floss but is actually tape width.
,February,2020,positive,"Pro: buon sapore, fresco al palato. Contro: struttura piatta che tende a “ tagliare “, soprattutto all’interno delle gengive."
,on,23,negative,The plastic wrapping wad opened and even the plastic cover of the product. very disappointed.
,on,15,negative,"I don’t recommend this product, it breaks in your mouth and it’s too slippery /elasticJust buy same brand, but the blue oneThanks"
,September,2020,positive,"a questo prezzo è meglio di altri, mi aspettavo meglio per la resa"
,on,9,positive,Looks and feel very cheap and definitely not an oral-b product
,on,9,negative,I've just come to learn Oral-B Flosses may contain PFAs that are linked to a whole host of health issues. If this is the case this is incredibly worrying. Please do your research and look for natural alternatives.
,on,2,negative,Item arrived on time and undamaged. But when I went to use the floss the box split in two so now it is useless!!! Not happy!
,on,12,negative,Very disappointing the box broke after the first time I used it making it very difficult to get out and use!
,on,4,negative,The container broke quite quickly so it was difficult to use
,September,2022,positive,"Prodotto ottimo, prezzo esagerato.Ho trovato il prodotto in altri shop a 2,70"
,on,22,negative,"Not as good as the ultra floss, it was difficult to use and didn’t do as good a job as the old stuff, I can’t understand why they have gone for this maybe because u will have to use more strands  to do the same job thereby buying more .  Definitely not recommended."
,on,17,negative,"Doesn't ""floss."" waste of money."
,on,29,negative,It's the first floss that I have ever used that snaps when being used.
,October,2022,negative,J'ai reçu mon colis mais on peut constater qu'il a été ouvert et refermé avec du scotch ce n'est pas normal
,on,4,negative,"The thread doesn't snap it's annoying, apart from that it's fine"
,on,30,negative,This arrived not sealed in the packet so don't really want to use it. Not a good item
,October,2020,positive,
,on,21,negative,"£1.70 per pack on subscription for many months, and suddenly it is £4.74 on subscription when you can buy it £2.85 without subscription or £4.52 for a 2 pack? GET YOUR PRICING STRUCTURE RIGHT. It's meant to be cheaper than the stand alone price!!"
,on,11,negative,Not recommended.
,on,25,negative,This product is NOT FLOSS IT IS TAPE. Huge difference and should state this
,on,16,negative,Does as expected and was cheaper.
,October,2019,positive,SolideIndoloreTexture sympa mais je n’aime pas le goût trop fort
,on,6,positive,It tends to fray and shred too easily but it is much better than some SOB ones.
,on,18,positive,This is OK. I thought I was getting floss but it is tape.
,October,2020,negative,"Me gusto el grosor aún que podría ser un poco más grueso, pero la cajita se ha desmontado toda, faltó más calidad en la caja del hilo, no me gustó este aspectos"
,April,2022,negative,"Muy caro! Para me no es profesional, es muy suave y para me no limpia las dientes como describa, no voy a volver a compra"
,on,12,negative,"It makes my tongue burn. A very burning sensation, like pins and needles at the tip my tongue. Only got it because it was 40m. Would not recommend at all."
,on,26,negative,It came with broken package
,on,11,positive,So over priced !!
,November,2017,negative,"Si tratta di un nastro come dice il nome e non di un filo, è largo circa 2mm ed è sottilissimo. Devo dire che è molto scivoloso e si fa fatica a tenerelo tra le dita in oltre ha un forte sapore di menta che non è di mio gusto. Comprato come prodotto plus costa meno che in farmacia."
,December,2017,negative,Filo interdentale comodo per il fatto che non e di filo ma di plastica/gomma. Da un po l’impressione che non pulisca bene
,October,2020,neutral,È stato consegnato un prodotto diverso da quello descritto: versione alla menta fresca. Questo non era stato indicato da Amazon. Anche l'imballaggio è saltato nel trasporto insieme ad altri articoli
3.0,January,2024,positive,Standard good quality unflavoured floss but it’s too expensive on Amazon.
3.0,January,2024,positive,Need more strength in the string . It’s easily breaking
3.0,December,2023,negative,"Mint flavor. But the thread gets split after flossing half of my teeth, as if its not strong enough."
2.0,February,2024,negative,This product it tears away after just flossing you start... all the fiber or threads become open.. i suggest Colgate one which have used for more more than 1yr. Much better than oral b
2.0,January,2024,negative,Better than the new released colgate floss but not the best as it frays in tight contact teeth . But colgate has ruined it's quality so this was the better choice . Can do better if the company increases it's quality .
2.0,December,2023,negative,"Don't buy unless you want to pay extra Rs 150 import charges. This is imported from UK and hence the price. Buy the Colgate one, it's the same I've used both. This just have the mint flavour in the floss. Does the same job."
3.0,October,2023,positive,Good ??
3.0,June,2023,positive,Product is imported so the quality is nice. The box as well as the floss smells like mint. Does the job well
3.0,July,2023,positive,I like it
2.0,September,2023,negative,"Product seems old, the toothpaste kind of coating dried and formed balls in the floss and tastws weird . I am not sure if its just my product."
2.0,September,2023,positive,"It is good to use, however, it expensive more than market price."
1.0,December,2023,negative,Thread is quite thin and breaks vertically so part of it is stuck between the teeth and it's annoying
3.0,February,2023,neutral,Not up to the mark
3.0,September,2021,negative,I have been using Oral-B floss for past 4-5 years. Of course the buying through different media. Also I have bought couple of times from Amazon in past but May be from different seller.But this particular product has wax crystallisation problem. The coated wax on thread comes out while pulling out the thread from the box.
2.0,February,2023,negative,Pathetic product by oral-B.The thread easily breaks while cleaning the teeth and many times the thread particles got stuck in between two teeths.... I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy this.. instead use dental floss with plastic handle .. Never go for a thread
1.0,December,2023,negative,Shredding and sticking in teeth.. ironically..
3.0,July,2022,neutral,The strings come out after flossing for a while. This didn't happen in the Pro version of oral b floss. But it's still pricey
2.0,May,2023,positive,The flavor is good but the quality of thread is poor...
1.0,June,2023,negative,The thread easily breaks into fibres as soon as you use it. It hurtsin your gums to use it.A lot of it is wasted in wrapping it around your fingers because the thread is slippery. A waste of money. Not a value for money product. Increase your budget and get a better product with stronger thread and better grip.
2.0,April,2023,positive,Breaks in fine threads
1.0,October,2023,negative,Terrible. Floss quality is so bad it breaks.
3.0,July,2022,negative,Price is huge but the purpose doesn't solve
2.0,January,2023,negative,It tears into minute thread lines on use. I found the colgate floss to be of higher quality. Won't order this again
3.0,April,2021,negative,The product is satisfactory but the price is way too expensive...I think it's manipulated price it shouldn't cost more than 200?( including taxes).Amazon listing says it's made in India but seller claimed it to be imported from UK...strange.
1.0,October,2023,negative,Thread quality is bad its becoming pieces
2.0,January,2023,negative,I like the smell but the sturdiness of floss is very poor. It just keeps breaking while using.
3.0,May,2021,neutral,I got the product with no part of the floss outside the opening. Had to open the case and get the floss out.
1.0,July,2023,negative,"I wouldn't recommend, it tears really easily and gets stuck"
3.0,March,2021,positive,Easy to use.
1.0,December,2021,positive,"Its threads come out and it breaks during usage.Not recommended esp. if you have rough tooth fillings.Only good thing is the mint freshness.You may find it OK if your teeth are even.Else, colgate floss is perfect except that it is not flavoured."
1.0,March,2023,negative,It started breaking everywhere after few days.
1.0,June,2022,positive,Very thick floss colgate has better floss preferably i wil not buy again go for colgate floss
1.0,August,2021,negative,"The floss is getting split into multiple layers after trying to use it. It is not advisable to purchase this as,if the floss remnants remains in between teeth it is not healthy"
1.0,March,2022,negative,Bad product. Breaks soo often. Colgate floss for 75 rs is far better than this.
1.0,July,2021,negative,"This is the worst quality floss I’ve ever used. Everytime u use it, the thread disintegrates and gets stuck b/w the teeth . It is an absolute disappointment."
1.0,October,2019,negative,The wax comes off and sticks to the mouth. Also the twine is delicate. The strands from the floss comes sticks in between the teeth and chokes everytime I tried to use it. I am fortunate I got a full refund from Amazon.
1.0,July,2022,negative,Not good
1.0,July,2020,neutral,I cannot use this as the thread isn't out and there is no way to pull it without opening the container. I believe seller is selling defective item in India
1.0,August,2020,negative,I have problems with my molar teeth and with this item you can’t reach to clean it. There is no mint flavour in it. Total waste of money.
3.0,June,2023,negative,"The floss thread is too thin and sharp. If you are not careful, it can hurt your gums. I liked the Colgate brand dental floss so much better."
1.0,July,2022,positive,
1.0,March,2021,negative,Product damaged. The floss is stick inside the box and no way to pull it up.
1.0,October,2021,negative,Not worth the money.. very poor quality
1.0,July,2021,positive,Too expensive on Amazon
1.0,June,2021,neutral,Not that sturdy at all...
1.0,August,2021,negative,Not good
1.0,February,2020,negative,Waste of money totally ...It is without wax ...It is just a ???????it is not capable of clean teeth....Useless....
1.0,March,2023,negative,"This is a really really cheap quality and dangerous product by Oral-B. It 'could' have been good with all that mint smell while flossing, but trust me, do NOT buy it even if someone gives it for free. It is so cheap that it disintegrates into multiple very very thin microstrands in your mouth while flossing, which you will end up digesting! If you don't want to eat all that plastic, don't buy this. Colgate Floss is a great alternative which is not 'mint smell', but at least does the job without making you eat plastic."
,December,2018,positive,"looks like 10 years old in stock,,,,,"
,September,2021,positive,Le fil est trop fin pour moi. Solide et parfumé il reste efficace.
,November,2020,negative,"La calidad es la que es, no hay más. Durante su uso se me ha deshilachado. El sabor a menta es lo que se espera. Dado su precio, tampoco se le puede pedir mas."
,on,8,negative,"The floss flakes apart, leaving white specs to snowflake down over your counter. But, it's cheap and does its job."
,October,2020,negative,"Il filo di per sé è ottimo. Lo avevo acquistato al supermercato ed era il mio preferito. Nello specifico però, quello che mi è arrivato a casa fa una cosa strana: quando lo ""giro"" tra le mani per bloccarlo, inizia a perdere ""pallini""..come se lo strato di menta si sgretolasse e mi ritrovo con pallini in mano ed in bocca. Non so a cosa sia dovuto.. Se forse l'articolo in questione non è originale,o forse solo l'unità che mi è arrivata era ""danneggiata"".. non saprei. Dopo qualche giorno mi è comparsa un'infezione alla bocca.. Potrebbe non essere assolutamente collegata al filo, ma per correttezza preferisco scriverlo"
,on,24,positive,"Floss is floss - it does the job and tastes nice. The flavouring is good, but it seems to flake. My floss flakes all over me when I use it - I think that is just the flavouring though. Could be better"
,on,30,negative,You cannot access the floss without breaking the box! Do not order from here- faulty item.
,on,18,positive,Just buying here because it's convenient
,on,18,negative,Both faulty...comes out shredded and or like tape...do not buy
,on,17,positive,"Good dental floss however in the product description it said the texture of the floss is shred resistant, it isn't shred resistant. But still good value for money and I would still recommend for the price."
,on,11,positive,Title.
,on,19,positive,Received 3 days late hence low rating. Product itself is fine.
,on,23,negative,I’m not sure it’s supposed to have such a strange flavour
,on,15,negative,Decent floss does shred quite easily and this one hurts your gums a bit more than the satin one. The satin one hurts less and doesn't shred at all. I wouldn't recommend you buy this one or the satin one from Amazon. Your local chemist probably has it for cheaper.
,October,2020,positive,"Filo interdentale molto economico rispetto a quanto si spende al supermercato per lo stesso, è buono ma si sfilaccia molto presto... Comunque certamente è usabile e a questo prezzo va bene.Magari solo non è semplicissimo il sistema per tagliarlo"
,on,17,positive,Perfectly every day item at a perfectly everyday price!Just as you'd get at a shop but with the convenience that Amazon brings.
,August,2020,negative,"E' un filo interdentale come tanti altri, forse leggermente un pò troppo spesso. Il vantaggio è che qui su amazon forse il prezzo è leggermente inferiore. Tuttavia ho avuto vari problemi con la consegna che è stata effettuata in ritardo."
,on,22,positive,I can get more at my dollar store for one pound.L
,on,8,negative,"I didn't buy this for it's purpose so my rating does not reflect how good it is for teeth.I bought it as a tool to thread beads onto loom bands. As this is waxed it is rather difficult to do, so I wouldn't recommend this to anyone wanting to purchase for the same reason as me."
,on,11,positive,It's ok. Has a mild minty flavour just frays alot while using
,on,13,negative,Feels a little weak and easily breaks. Could be im too rough but i feel like other brands have a stronger floss.
,on,11,negative,"I did not get on well with this floss compared to my usual brand. It is much more rigid, which probably makes it stronger, but I found that using it after just a couple of days cut the corners of my mouth. Too sharp for me! It did clean between my teeth ok but I will be going for a softer and wider variety next time."
,August,2020,positive,Marca ottimaprodotto anche molto utile per i denti dopo i pasti.solo chd odore non mi e piaciuto e  il prezzo e un po alto
,May,2018,negative,"Le fil est un peu fragile, se casse très facilement mais à part ça il fait son job et laisse une odeur agréable avec son parfum menthe.C'est très important d'après mon dentiste d'utiliser du fil dentaire 2 fois par jour min afin d'avoir des dents en bonne santé sans tartre et bactéries"
,August,2020,negative,È al mentolo cosa che non c’è scritta. È molto spesso rispetto ai normali fili interdentali.Si spezza con gran facilità.Spedizione Amazon veloce
,on,22,positive,Works fine but annoying to use as the floss tends to split
,on,7,negative,I have bought these for a few months now but for the past 2 months I can smell a mouldy damp smell frm them like they've got damp at some point or kept in a room with mould.I have now stopped my subscription for this item.
,February,2021,negative,"se rompe fácil, y demasiado grueso según mi parecer"
,May,2021,positive,Pensavo più pratico
,on,30,negative,The quality isn't as good as store bought ones; almost as if it skipped some quality checks. The floss was stuck at first and I had to open up the casing to fix but it is still usable.
,on,29,negative,I find it a bit too thin and smooth which means it doesnt remove the food and plaque as well as other brands
,on,1,positive,"its long ,strong and a good price however it dose not really grip onto any food stuff so even after flossing the same gap food still remains, thinking maybe a tape floss would be better ."
,on,15,negative,"I always struggle to open this package.Not the cardboard but the actual plastic which holds the floss.If you do it very gently it will open (sometimes)If you get frustrated and put more force into it, you will break your fingers trying to pry it open."
,February,2020,positive,Sapore alla menta che lascia una freschezza molto gradevole in bocca. Filo resistente e di una lunghezza che dura per abbastanza tempo.
,on,4,positive,It does the job
,December,2020,positive,Bien
,on,5,negative,Pretty bad
,on,10,negative,"Don’t buy this it’s thinner than cotton, impossible to use. Despite its thinness it splits. Gets stuck in your teeth. I’ve thrown it in the bin."
,January,2021,negative,"Questo filo interdentale è troppo aggressivo per le mie gengive sensibili. Inoltre non pulisce come si deve. L’ultra floss era eccezionale, non capisco perché non venga più prodotto. Un vero peccato"
,on,16,negative,Flimsy and poor quality. Better off buying my floss from local supermarkets. Dispenser jammed and the floss kept breaking in my teeth. Would not recommend
,July,2020,negative,Lo acquisto da tempo e sempre soddisfatto.A questo giro packaging danneggiato ed essendo una cosa che poi metto in bocca non mi ha fatto molto piacere.
,on,1,negative,Normally order floss from my local supermarket. When I received the product it was poor quality and the floss is very flimsy and of poor quality. Would recommend buying from your local supermarket or a better version. Like others have said the item is not eligible for a refund so buy elsewhere and avoid this product.
,September,2020,negative,"Il filo è profumato ed il rapporto qualità prezzo è ottimo, ma rispetto al filo interdentale oral b 3D white luxe, ha una qualità più bassa, si sfilaccia subito. Tornerò al mio vecchio filo."
,August,2019,negative,"Ottimo prodotto, consegna rapida, peccato che nella descrizione non ci sia scritto che è un filo al mentolo. Avrei preferito fosse neutro."
,July,2020,negative,Sembra sia vecchio in quanto di sfilaccia facilmente
,on,17,negative,"This floss has a strong smell, a chemical smell, and it's poor quality."
,on,3,positive,ok
,on,13,negative,"This product is poor, the floss comes apart leaving strands in gums and mouth. Won't order this again."
,July,2020,positive,buon prodotto!
,on,14,negative,Snaps often and difficult to use.
,December,2020,negative,Ho aperto l’involucro di plastica e ho trovato il cosino di plastica rotto

2.0,October,2023,negative,"Colgate floss which was once better they became worseoral b is also worsefloss is stiff like fishing wire,,gets stuck in between teethpls make good ones"
3.0,March,2023,positive,THIK THAK
2.0,June,2023,negative,"Price is samebas MRP... But quality is not as good as before...!! Without any pressure, just by normal flossing, the threads became multi-strands... Even those thin strands getting stucked between teeth... ????????"
1.0,August,2023,negative,Regretfully I bought a bunch of these. The floss is wire thin and stiff like fishing wire. If not careful it'll chew your gums to bits. I'll find other uses for it but I don't like it as floss.
1.0,September,2023,negative,The floss is very thin and it is coming as pieces and they are stucking in between teeth.
1.0,August,2023,positive,One year old stock
3.0,February,2020,negative,"Oral B floss doesn’t require any review. It’s undoubtably the best. The only strange thing was what I received here. None of the three packs had any mandatory stamps of expiry/manufacturing, date of import etc as evident in the attached photos. The plastic spool, however, had the usual stamping. Don’t know if I got an original product."
1.0,June,2023,negative,I just noticed that the dental floss i bought had expired in 2019 I want other potential buyers to be careful & not buy this
1.0,May,2022,negative,"Product is imported from Ireland and supposed to be high quality. It mentioned that the dental floss does not fray - get worn out. But this Oral B dental floss is horrible. I used to use Colgate floss which was far better, but Oral B we cannot even use it once to clean. The floss disintegrates in your mouth and you are left with very thin plastic strands stuck to your teeth. My intestines must be full of this plastic by now. PATHETIC BRAND!!!"
3.0,July,2021,positive,Barely satisfied with the quality!
3.0,March,2021,positive,Easy to use
1.0,March,2022,negative,Don't buy it. Don't justify the quality compair to its price.

1.0,June,2022,positive,I only received two out of three.
1.0,June,2021,positive,The quality is crap
1.0,October,2023,negative,"My last Oral B Mint floss lasted me a whole year, where as this floss keeps on disintegrating, either it tears or gets jumbled up, I have no idea how did they ruin something that was so perfect."
1.0,January,2020,negative,"Most hopeless floss, very rough and poorly waxed.. Harmful for the enamel"
1.0,August,2020,positive,Have received an expired product
3.0,September,2021,positive,It is a pack of three each priced at MRP Rs110. Can get easily from a nearby store. How do they mentioned it price at Rs765. I got it for 395 which is more than MRP.
,February,2024,positive,Temps de livraison trop long.
,June,2023,positive,Malgré que ce produit soit d'une belle marque et qu'il sent bon à la menthe je trouve que le fil est un peu fin
,October,2023,negative,Durch die dünne Zahnseide  entstehen oft Verletzungen am Zahnfleisch. Hatte vorher welche v. Edeka Mark. Etwas teurer aber auch dicker. Diese reinigte  die Zahnzwischenräume besser .beim nächsten Einkauf kaufe ich mir andere Zahnseide.
,on,17,negative,I was unable to buy the floss from local chemist so was pleased to receive order within a couple of days - well priced
,on,7,positive,"This is a review of Amazon, not of the floss.  The floss is excellent, my preferred brand and style.  HOWEVER, the Amazon carrier (probably a local Door Dash driver or something) left it at a neighbor's house (a vacant house for sale), not mine.  I finally received it three months later when the owner found the package in her garage.  The same happened to another package that went to a different neighbor's house, but we tracked it more closely since it was critical.  If I can find a place to review Amazon I will put this review there.  Meanwhile, I am trying to shop any place else besides Amazon."
,March,2023,negative,The package was not fullThere should be 3 flossBut there was only 2
,September,2023,negative,Contrairement à ce qui est annoncé ces fils dentaires ne sont ni cirés ni mentholés et sont de très mauvaise qualité.
,on,10,positive,"This was actually painful for me, but my wife thought it was OK.  It would be good for people with very tight spacing between teeth, but not mine.  Felt like elastic fishing line."
,on,9,positive,It’s ok but a lot thinner than the other oral b floss I have bought so not as effective
,April,2016,negative,"Le produit en lui même est pas mal , sauf qu'il s'abime trop rapidement , le temps de livraison est trèssss long , le goût est pas mal même si trop peu à mon goût , vous recevrez 3 rouleaux , sinon voilà c'est pas mal , mais je le trouve peu utile ."
,on,14,negative,Floss falls into container having to reopen and line up
,May,2014,negative,"Le fait qu'il soir ciré et mentholé est agréable, le fil ne blesse pas, il remplit bien sa fonction mais il n'est pas facile à tenir car il est vraiment ciré..."
,on,18,negative,"Very bad quality, It tears off when you’re trying to use it will not buy it ever again"
,February,2012,negative,"Je suis très déçu par ce produit. S'effiloche au moindre accro et devient coupant, de plus la cire qui enduit le fil ne tient pas correctement. Direct à la poubelle, les fils dentaires en téflon de supermarché sont nettement supérieurs."
,February,2014,neutral,Le produit reçu ne correspond pas à la photo... vous recevrez des fils dans une petite boîte et non un fil de 50m dans un dérouleur en plastique!
1.0,September,2023,negative,Not easy to use
2.0,February,2019,neutral,It was not upto our expectations.
,August,2019,negative,Lo he recibido muy tarde con el envase hecho polvo y la fecha de caducidad pasada pero al no estar en español
,June,2014,negative,???????????????????????????????????????????
,on,22,positive,"Good product, however the page describes this as a pack of 6, but only one was delivered.  Product itself is a 5 star item, marking down to a 3 as the value for money is woeful."
,January,2024,negative,"Zahnseide ist für mich nicht zu benutzen, da sie sehr stark duftet und dementsprechend auch schmeckt."
,on,10,negative,I ordered these because they used to be the best for cleaning around and under the bridges of my teeth. They are not the same quality as before. The threader end is not as stiff and makes it a little harder to thread under your bridge. The fuzzy part is really not very fuzzy anymore. It is more like the old tape dental floss as far as being a sufficient tool. I am really disappointed in this product.
,December,2023,negative,"Great idea for people with bridges/implants to get into those tight spots. However, I find the supposed reinforced end not so strong. I am used to using the floss threaders, which are more sturdy. With these, it often takes a long time to get it to go between the implant and my gums but with a threader, it goes in easy every time.I also don't like the floss part, as it feels too flimsy and shreds easily."
,on,12,negative,Not really happy of the purchase. I got just one package instead of six I paid for.
,on,16,negative,Didn’t realize I had ordered mint flavor. This tastes like mint essence with a petroleum finish.  The unflavored ones do not taste like petroleum.
,on,2,negative,"Little hard to use,way to long,and hard to get between bridge."
,February,2024,negative,Vor einigen Jahren hat es sich gelohnt die teuren Floss von OralB zu kaufen. Heute nicht mehr.Der Floß ist viel dünner geworden als früher. Der verstärkte Faden an der Seite ist auch nicht mehr shr steif.Die Verpackung und die Entnahmen läßt auch zu wünschen übrig.
,October,2023,negative,"Die Zahnseide hat zu wenig ""flausch"" also nutzbaren Bereich in der Mitte. Zudem wird die Zahnseide, wenn man sie mit örtlichen Drogerien vergleicht, viel zu teuer verkauft (was mir leider erst hinterher aufgefallen ist). Zum Schluß sei noch gesagt, dass es eher was für die großen Zahnzwischenräume ist."
,on,13,neutral,"Purchased to floss under my bridge but the floss is thick and doesn't slide well, uncomfortable."
,on,26,negative,"It's not the same as the ones I got from the dentist's office, and it's not easy to use."
,on,28,neutral,Have used these for a long time to get under bridge. They seem thinner and certainly not as smooth. Don’t work as well as they used to.??Guess it’s like everything else today less is cheaper to make.
,on,23,negative,"This was recommended by my periodontist, but I found it didn't work well for me. I've been having oral surgery and wearing splinted temporary crowns. Regular floss can't be used with splints, so the idea was to thread the super floss through the space at the gum line. The floss has three distinct textures: a hard end, like the aglet on a shoelace, only thinner; a crisp length, for scraping; and a soft length, like the floss everyone knows best. The crisp length wound up cutting my gums where I had stitches, and I wasn't able to continue using it."
,on,29,negative,I purchased these to floss under a permanent bonded retainer. These are such poor quality. If I could rate w/ negative stars then I would. These are so thin and flimsy. Picture of what the floss did when I pushed it through 2 teeth. It wouldn’t even go through.
,on,11,negative,"I do not recommend this product. The most annoying aspect is that the floss shreds as you use it and gets stuck in your teeth.  The product is shown having two sides to thread, but really only has one side to thread.  The threader only works if you have a large space for it to thread into.  If the space is small, the threader bends and does not go through.  I like the concept of a floss threader, but the needle needs to be stronger/thicker and the floss stronger so it doesn’t shred."
,on,18,negative,These do NOT work for dental bridges. You need floss with a more rigid end to get through the bridge near the gum and this is not the right tool for it. Do not waste your money.
,on,18,negative,The thread part is constantly getting stuck in my braces and then I have to use tweezers to pull that out. Not with it to ms
,August,2022,negative,"I have used this super floss for so many years and it had been an excellent tool to clean around by dental bridgework. Something has changed in the manufacture and the quality is rather inferior. The stiffened section designed to thread easily under bridgework or braces is now too soft and floppy and difficult to push through smaller spaces. The fluffy part of the floss, designed to capture more food and plaque is coarser with less grip though. I do not understand why these have changed after so many years of being an invaluable dental hygiene tool. The only answer i can come up to is that the production costs have dropped dramatically to create this inferior product.I will have to look for a different product for this task in future I feel."
,on,18,positive,Don’t like skinny floss & then fatter floss manufactured together.  Dr Tungs is the best for flossing!
,on,14,negative,Did not receive full order. Only received 2 packs when I paid for 3.
,on,30,negative,product is useless for bridges..there is really no stiff end to floss..also box comes opened...not sealed...does not seem like real oral b product...and no way to return.....gives you link to oral B which says can only be returned if bought from oral B
,on,25,negative,It breaks apart in an instant.You can not return it either
,on,8,negative,"I was hoping this might be an easier to use alternative to floss threaders I have used in the past. Unfortunately, the threading component of these is not nearly rigid enough to fit through tight spaces. To make matters worse, the floss tears much more quickly than even average floss. Altogether, this isn’t so much super floss as pre-cut sub par floss."
,on,10,negative,"Imbreakable core that can be very painful, coated with expanding floss that breaks loose on first passage and wreaks havoc on braces. I got it to clean under my permanent brace. Ended up spending an hour trying to pull out all the strands with tweezers and with a regular floss. The strands stuck under the braces also resulted in increased pressure on the teeth which was painful...Horrible product! I regret using it a lot more than I care about the waist of money! Avoid at all costs!"
,on,8,neutral,The plastic tip is not thick enough and that makes it hard to use with a bridge.
,on,4,negative,"Don’t use this if you have any tight teeth/etc. They shred and leave pieces stuck in between. 3 teeth in and it’s unusable. I first tried these years ago and they did the same thing, no improvement."
,on,21,negative,"I prefer the normal version of this same floss rather than pre-cut product. It has small area for floss and huge dangling normal threats for holding on to. The design is inefficient. So, I won't be purchasing again."
,on,7,negative,The box was torn and open.
,on,16,negative,I won’t buy again. There is no strong tip to help get under the bridge for what I bought it for. I bought another kind of this brand hoping to get floss with a hard end for bridges.  Again I got packages I cannot use. I will not order this brand again.
,on,12,negative,"Was hoping I could use these for all my teeth but too thin and break easily so only good cor bridge.  However , lead string  is sometimes hard to get between crowns to get started. Also don’t like the packaging. Won’t buy again"
,on,21,negative,"I ordered this product for my bridges. It doesn’t work for my bridges because the1 side that you pull through is not stiff enough to pull through the bridge.Only use is for floss, which is not why I ordered it!Seller will do nothing for you when contacted.Plus they aren’t wrapped individually, you open the pack & they are all there, not like the ones I used to order that I loved, that were discontinued.It’s defective, & shouldn’t be sold to be used for a bridge on Amazon."
,on,9,negative,So disappointed
,on,14,neutral,"First of all, I'm not sure how one would even use these regularly, especially someone who has hand pain or lack of precision in the hands.You stick them under the bridge, and then you have to thread it all the way to the back of your mouth, then dig the end of it out with your fingers before you can floss.  Water pik is way better than trying to do this every day.The way they are packaged makes it almost impossible to just pull one at a time out.  They come out in a tangled mess.I would not recommend these for people with bridges.  And people without bridges can more easily use the floss picks.In other words, I have no idea what these are even for."
,on,1,positive,The product is ok.  I like another brand better. But it wasn’t available. This one is difficult to get out of the package.
,on,3,negative,"First of all, I called and complained about this product which arrived late in a smashed box with the floss outside of the box and then when I used it the floss started breaking almost immediately.  Maybe this was unusual, but I would not buy again."
,on,4,negative,Product supposedly has stiffened ends that thread through teeth. Ends are too soft to work
,on,12,negative,"Floss is disappointing and I prefer Glide. The plastic coated end of the floss is so flimsy it is difficult to insert between teeth. The floss itself is too thick and not smooth, making it difficult to pull through. The strands are packaged in such a way that they get tangled up with each other. All in all I cannot recommend this product."
,on,27,negative,"Used it for my all on 4 implants, this doesn’t work or even gets to the most obvious areas- total fail!!"
,November,2022,negative,"In der Anzeige steht ausdrücklich 6Stück, aber geliefert wurde nur eine Packung, das ist nicht in Ordnung"
,on,13,neutral,It does not have a slightest resemblance to a teeth floss. You can't even start to slide between the teeth. Buy it if you wanted to sharpen your teeth. Tossed it out.
,March,2023,positive,regular floss is much better.
,June,2019,positive,PRIMA HANDHABUNG.OK
,on,25,negative,"Correct me if I’m wrong, description says pack of 6. 50 strands. So I was expecting six boxes with 50 strands each. I only received one box with 50 strands. Box looks old and a bit dewy too? I thought I got a good deal but I feel like I got cheated."
,February,2021,negative,"Braucht man halt, egal was es kostet"
,June,2020,negative,Die Zahnseide kam völlig zerdrückt bei mir an. Eigentlich hatte ich die Zahnseide mit Floss für meine Brückenreinigung bestellt. Leider musste ich feststellen das der Flossanteil auf den vorgeschnittenen Stücken minimal und viel zu klein ist. Zahnseide habe ich selbst. Ich hatte gedacht das mehr Flossanteil dabei ist. Der Preis und die Qualität stimmen überhaupt nicht.
,on,31,positive,Should have received a pack of 6 but only one pack turned up
,January,2020,negative,Verpackung kam beschädigt an im Großen und ganz nicht wie erwartet
,on,17,negative,These do not work well for tight spaces. They often got stuck in-between my molars and I had to use a thinner glide floss to get the broken up floss out. It also sometimes took 2-3 pieces to floss my teeth due to the softer part breaking apart.
,December,2019,negative,Ich schließe mich der Bewertung von Iven Twellmeyer vom Mai an. Packung sieht aus wie schon mal gebraucht . Die Zahnseide sieht aus wie nachträglich eingeschweißt . Genau wie auf den Fotos von dem genannten Rezensor. Wäre es mir nicht zu blöd würde ich es zurückschicken . Hier bestelle ich definitiv nicht meh.
,on,18,positive,The description on this was that it was a pack of 6. I ordered a quantity of 2 so was expecting 12 boxes. What was received was 2 boxes! Beware!
,on,7,negative,I was looking for Glide but it was hard to come by. Too harsh on gums and too stringy to remove from bag.
,on,17,negative,"After pulling 1 or 2 strands from the package, the next one became completely entangled with all of the other strands. I tried to fix the issue, but it ended up getting worse. I finally had to throw it out in the trash because it was useless. I couldn't find anywhere to contact the seller."
,on,8,negative,Product arrived promptly but should of been 6 packs of 50 and only received 1 pack of 50 and the package was battered.
,on,9,positive,Should have been a pack of 6 but only 1 arrived
,on,12,negative,"Super thick, not comfortable and it broke my wire. These are so difficult to use for most people with any kind of retainer or braces."
,on,13,negative,Floss coarse...did not slide between teeth well. All strands packaged together...hard to get out.Tossed product
,on,28,negative,"Doesnt say its mint floss on the packaging, but it is"
,on,27,negative,My dentist recommended this as an alternate for dental floss. I bought it in good faith and was sorely disappointed. It frays when it is used as a floss( what it is supposed to be used as). And then one has the problem of how to get all those little hairlike threads from between one's teeth out! A messy and most unpleasant ordeal. A real bummer of a product!
,May,2019,positive,"Das Produkt sieht aus als hätte es jemand 1 Monat in der Gesäßtasche getragen, nach über 5 Wochenhätte ich das besser und preiswerter bei ""budni "" bekommen. Für ein Hygieneprodukt bemerkenswert"
,on,25,neutral,Only contains one pack and isn't mint either.
,on,12,negative,I can’t use this floss. It is so thick that it hurts to slide between my teeth. So sad this got substituted for my normal delivery.
,on,22,negative,Difficult to use! Need 3-4 to clean all teeth. By that time my fingers hurt. The floss thread is hard to pull.
,on,1,positive,The Oral-B super floss was impossible to insert between some of my bridges.  Apparently the spacing between my  teeth is too narrow.  Now I am using the Crest Glide Threader Floss which works great.  Just hope I can continue to buy the Threader Floss from Crest.
,on,7,negative,I got these cause they were a cheaper alternative to another brand. This floss felt like fabric between my teeth and it was pretty difficult and unpleasant to use.
,on,29,negative,Kept on breaking in my teeth
,on,5,negative,This floss is worthless. Too thin and poorly cut. A waste of time and $.
,on,17,negative,It was broken and seems used! I am so outraged ?
,on,13,positive,Thanks
3.0,January,2024,negative,"Oral B tooth brush is good if it works but durability is not good . I have changed nearly 4 brushes in 1 year and also replaced the brush heads , The issue is either the water gets inside the battery compartment and rust forms in the terminals  and stops working and the buttons are like alien it works some times and it works when u throw it .Advantage is u can change the AA Battery and keep using it not required to charge  ."
1.0,May,2022,negative,"TLDR: If you are thinking of buying this then DON'T, a normal tooth brush will provide better cleaning than this toy. If you want to buy an electric tooth brush save up and go for the proper Pro line, it really does provide a better cleaning vs manual brushes even with proper techniques especially along the gum line.Full ReviewThis toy does not come even remotely close to the performance of the proper electric oral b brush.My pro 600 is now old so the battery does not last long so I thought to try this battery toothbrush since it also has a rotating head but the difference in performance is night and day.The battery toothbrush motor does not have enough torque to prevent it from slowing down the moment even the slightest pressure is applied and I mean very little pressure like trying to clean the wisdom teeth on upper jaw, the head is too big and bulky for easy maneuvering. The low torque also does not clean the teeth surface well.The whole point of the electric brush is to clean more effectively with more strokes per second, you just glide it along the teeth with next to no regular brushing motion and the rotation and pulsing of the brush head does a thorough cleaning. This toy does not have the rotation speed to clean just by spinning and you have to do the manual moving of brush like a regular brush which IMO defeats the whole purpose.Avoid the battery toy. If you want to buy an electric toothbrush just save up for a proper one, no need to go for higher models costing 5-6k buy the entry one its performance is same for basic cleaning and it performs just as well as the more expensive ones. All it lacks is the fancy modes that change the pulsating speed of the brush head. Those modes don't really add any value to the teeth cleaning.The quality of bristles is also higher on the pro line of brushes they don't start to fray or disintegrate at the speed of cheaper manual brushes. This battery brush has less dense bristles and they also feel lower quality. The pic shows a Pro 600 brush head that is over 1 year old vs a new battery brush with 1 use on it."
3.0,February,2024,neutral,"Expensive brushes by Oral B, 2000/- for two brushes still no case, cover or travel case is being provided by the company."
3.0,January,2024,negative,"This is basically a ""false advertising"" from this brand... The timer is not available on this brush... It will never work... If it was available I would've given 5 star. That's an L."
3.0,February,2024,positive,It's very good liked the product cleans tooth very nicely....
3.0,January,2024,neutral,ToothBrush battery didn't last even for two months though I am using it once a days usually others brush battery last for six month atleast.

3.0,September,2023,negative,"While this is no doubt value for money, I have used the other Oral B Vitality 100 model as well.Comparison1. The Vitality model is almost 2.5 times the price but worth it2. This model creates a lot of noise and vibrations,It has two sets of cleaning brushes, one is supposed to rotate and other vibrate. Hence the noise and extreme vibrations. On the other hand Vitality 100 has just a rotary round brush3.The rotatory part of brush is the main cleaning brush and in this model, it stops rotating as soon as you apply even a little pressure for a better clean. This is hard to realise that this has stopped  since there is lot of vibration from other part of the brush - resulting in poorer cleaning.The Vitality model however does the job very well and the rotor doesn't stop so easily - it continues to rotate and scrub the tooth surface.4. The overall head size of this model is too big for comfort esp for teenagers. On the other hand - Vitality 100 is absolutely perfectMy verdict - go for Vitality 100 if you don't mind spending 2.5x the amount - but it's worth the extra."
2.0,February,2024,negative,Review after 6 months of usage . Better not buy this one because the major drawback is it is not rechargeable. You have to change the battery s within 20 days . If it is Duracell then it will last a bit more . The battery will cost 25 rupees for 25 days and for 2 brush head cost 490 rupees . There is a duplicate (8 for 490) option but it is very slow which won't give a proper cleaning. At first we feel like it's a great deal but it's not .
3.0,November,2023,negative,The product performs as promised or expected.However there is no user manual especially for its maintenance and upkeep.What is worrying is that the tooth paste foam trickles down to the handle which houses the batteries.This creates a worry on how to clean the unit without the watertrickling into the battery housing leading to a short circuit.
3.0,December,2023,positive,good but ok ok
3.0,November,2023,negative,"Ease of use is not the great. At the time of brushing, foam which is in the mouth comes out on the brush, it feels messy!"
2.0,February,2024,positive,The Brush's mexhanism is good and unique and I liked how it cleaned. But the motor and parts are extremely poor quality. I have bought 2 and bothe have stopped functioning. Sad how good design has been brought down by poor quality parts.
3.0,November,2023,positive,Too bulky
3.0,October,2023,positive,"It’s best in the price rangeCleans well, easy to change the top.But it’s bit noisy and vibrations are bit high when you are brushing it affects.Rest it all about the budget.."
2.0,January,2024,negative,I put  new batteries in the tooth brush but it stops and does not work. Sometimes when I shake it vigorously it does start but stops again. I would like a replacement or I can buy a better one and pay the difference.
2.0,January,2024,negative,"The vibration on my brush has become very sluggish after around 3-4 months use. Thinking it's the battery, I changed to a new Duracell and it was the same. Tried another battery too but still the same. It's so sluggish that the moment I put it on my teeth, it simply grinds to a halt. Now I'm going to try their costlier model, the Pro 1000 with the hope that it will work."
2.0,February,2024,positive,product is good but normal brush is batter then dis and clean batter then this brush so not worth it at all
3.0,August,2023,negative,I used it. Battery dead. And now I am back to my simple toothbrush. Guess it was just a phase to try a different kind of toothbrush.Why waste money in this .It is better to buy a tooth brush made from eco friendly materials like bamboo or simply use Datun. This item is sort of a gimmick. You will use it when it's new and then you will go back to ur regular brush. So buy it if you have an itch to spend money. Haha
2.0,February,2024,negative,Battery not properly work.didnt brushed properly.. only two three months.i was purchased .not worked.
2.0,July,2023,negative,"This is my second oral b criss cross. The last one lasted a couple of months back in 2015. This new one lasted hardly a week.First let me clarify, this isn't a rotating head, it turns slightly back and forth that's all, the bottom one just moves back and forth it's not that great since u use the round head to work around the teeth for the most part, brush works good at cleaning when the head is at an angle only, basically vibrates, the vibrations were strong enough to clean and remove stain marks at the start, it started getting stuck in between the tooth gaps and the pulsations stop when that happens u have to ease the slightest amount of pressure to get it back into action. I thought maybe a weak Chinese battery and changed to a Duracell, resumed working like new again just for a day . Until it completely stopped vibrating. Head just stops any action whatsoever at the slightest pressure . Disappointed wanted it to work atleast for a couple of months . Go for Sonic toothbrushes with twist removable heads, this one's a pain to get the head swapped. Maybe it's just my unit that was faulty , but nostalgia says otherwise since it failed the same way.Got it around the 350? range .My honest advice spend a little bit more and get something more reliableHappy shopping"
2.0,January,2024,negative,It makes more noise than cleaning teeth.
3.0,August,2023,positive,
3.0,October,2023,negative,Leads to dental problems
1.0,February,2024,negative,The round and vibrating motion both does nothing for my teeth . The front rotates at high velocity hence barely touching teeth and back part is not engaging at all . Total waste of money . I prefer Colgate charcoal over it . It’s vibrating only but cleanses like freshly done scaling procedure .
2.0,October,2023,negative,"I won't recommend this brush to anyone. Mine stopped working within two weeks since I bought it. I think the battery compartment was not waterproof and when I checked there were water droplets inside. I tried drying it and switching on again but the brush remained dead. Only good thing happened is when I asked for warranty claim, the company responded positively and offered me a gift voucher of same amount. However I bought a rechargeable brush with that voucher, additionally paying some more money."
1.0,February,2024,negative,"Ordered this for my 87 year old mom, put the batteries but it does not work. Tried to return but says this is not eligible for returns. Piece costs Rs. 1000 and no returns. This is ridiculous."
3.0,March,2023,negative,"So, I recently tried this and I have to say, my teeth have felt more sensitive. This toothbrush is rusting from the inside. I mean, I knew I needed to up my iron intake, but this is getting ridiculous.But hey, at least the two-minute timer works.In all seriousness, it isn't the worst toothbrush I've ever used. It gets the job done, even if it's not exactly gentle on my pearly whites. Just make sure to keep it dry and clean to avoid the rust situation."
1.0,February,2024,positive,It worked fine for about 3months and then it would stop in between and make a long beep. I tried changing battery but I'm facing the same problem yet again.
1.0,January,2024,negative,"I think I absolutely wasted my money on this toothbrush. The brush stopped functioning properly after 3-4 uses. Instead of vibrating at its usual frequency, it gets stuck and wobbles. It didn't matter even when the battery is of high quality and totally new. Waste of money."
3.0,June,2023,positive,"It's good for the price but, you know the delivery experience is awful, it got delayed and even delayed it by a day, but still though the features are on another level for the price."

1.0,February,2024,neutral,The toothbrush timer is not at all working. And it’s non refundable. So it’s better buy from out side
1.0,February,2024,negative,Its dead now after 1 and a half years of usage. Colgate sonic brush is better which is older than Oral B and is still functional.
3.0,May,2023,positive,Not working properly after 1 month . May be my piece is defective but .. not expecting those defective pieces from Oral B or Amazon . I have to admit during first month I have seen good results .
3.0,March,2023,positive,The brush is good in terms of its bristle lasting longer and the motor working even now. But the holding rubber starts melting on its own and then the motor starts  working only when you set it in a certain way. If they could've improved the holding rubber of better quality to protect the motor inside the brush could be more durable to use.
1.0,February,2024,negative,I now have to hold the button continuously to brush. Annoying.
3.0,March,2023,negative,Not as good i expected. Better go for a premium category with small brush head. This ones head is too big.  It just vibrates. No effective.  U have to use it more like a normal brush.
3.0,July,2023,neutral,Doesn't give results like the traditional 30-50 Rs. Toothbrushes.
1.0,November,2023,negative,PLEASE CLICK HELPFUL SO IT REACHES OUT TO EVERYONEI've been using perfora brush which was just vibrating and nothing else so later I tried this brush and due to hard vibrations and extreme pressure it created after a week usage of the brush now my teeth are suffering a lot and I'm in lot of pain daily. I'm actually very careful about teeth but my baddest decision in life to use this brush led me to loose Enamel layer and Gums loosening. Please guys don't use it. Use super soft or soft bristles only. The one's which come with this brush are not just hard but super hard.

3.0,April,2023,positive,Product is good but after few months battery drain very fast we have to change battery at every 10 days
3.0,September,2017,positive,"•Firstly, you may think that this electric brush has a spinning round head and vibraring flat brush. That's not true. The round head rotates to and fro through around 10 - 20° angle rapidly. And the flat brush vibrates in to and fro in one plane.•Now, about the cleaning performance. It's below average.~The round head functions well. If we try to stop it from vibrating with our finger, it still resists and keeps vibrating.~The flat part though, it stops vibrating even with a slight pressure on the top. So in your mouth, don't expect anything but the round part to work properly.This is when the battery power is full. When the battery begins to wear off, the vibrations become weak and the cleaning ability becomes worse.*Using the brush*- I brush like normal with the vibrations assisting in the cleaning process. A lot of vibrations go to the entire brush so not much goes to the brush head. It's more of a massage to your hand. Also the brush head is larger than non electric brushes so it's going to be a large fit in the mouth.~>I found myself shift back to a normal brush after using this for a month. I spend longer using this electric brush, and don't get any advantage. Plus it's very noisy. Sounds like a dirt motorcyle engine.•Unless you want to show off, continue using a manual brush. Or else, buy a more expensive electric toothbrush that actually works. This is just a gimmick mechanism in my opinion. It's good. But not practical.PLEASE SHOW YOUR APPRECIATION FOR MY REVIEW BY PRESSING THE *helpful* BUTTON. THANK YOU :)"

2.0,June,2022,negative,I have used this toothbrush for 25 days and for the first 10 days i am using very carefully applying very less pressure and even after brushing for 4 min my teeth are not even clearing before that when I was using my normal brush it was far more better than that this electric brush has hard bristle it does not have an rotation speed and vibration controller It does not also clean the area where teeth are placed curved if u want to clean than u have to apply more pressure so that bristle can reach the place where u want to clean and due to this u will see in some time your teeth enamel is becoming light transparent type so be carefull using it if u apply light pressure then it will not clean and If u apply more pressure it will lead enemal damage so my suggestion go for some expensive one or use your normal toothbrush and always use soft bristles toothbrush so if u apply high pressure it will not effect your teeth enamel
2.0,June,2023,positive,The system is good. Worked for 3-4 days. But then one day I wake up and the brush is running on automatically. Probably some problem with the button. But now its gone. So yes will work good for 3-4 days but then no one knows!

2.0,August,2021,positive,"1 Year Usage Review :I have been using this electric brush for the past year now. (Have been thinking of writing this review  and changing the brush since long)The top head rotates (well practically move clockwise and anticlockwise) which is a good thing. The bottom bristles has front-backward motion. Overall (if it work properly) this combination works wonders.Slighted thicker top.The AA Duracell batteries last about a couple of months.The brush head stop moving after lets say a week or two. The bottom part will still work but the rotating head will stop the movement.You may think you have to change the head as you may have damaged the same but wait that's not the issue. You change the head it works for a week and stop working, again.Now you may think of changing the batteries but that too won't help out.Order new heads and the results were same. THE HEAD WON'T MOVE.It worked great until it worked but after the first head started giving problem it never worked like it should have been."
3.0,March,2020,positive,"It is a good product if you have never used it and good to show off too!but it cannot be a direct substitute for your regular toothbrush.It could replace regular toothbrush only when it has thinner base & longer bristles like regular tooth brush,.the thick base makes it difficult for the brush to reach the grinders at the Far end and this makes it uncomfortable to use and in turn using this toothbrush becomes more time consuming than a regular  tooth brush...Again the brush end has some open places showing the rods that help in the vibration when are difficult to clean after each use and raises a question of hygiene. All in all good to show off but not good for day to day morning / evening usage."
1.0,November,2023,negative,"It is vibration brush and useless, waste of money.  I purchased on the understanding, it is rotating brush. Hopeless product."
3.0,June,2022,negative,"I used it for 6 months, gave up and back to normal brush as my teeth quality detoriated..again its person to person but my personal advice use ur own muscle to clean your own bones."
1.0,November,2023,negative,The product stopped working within a week of uasge and amazon refused to help at all. Never buy it
3.0,November,2020,neutral,"This is classic example of consumerism. Practically this brush solves a purpose but if you use it, you would realize that you don't actually need it. It doesn't lessen your efforts to brush. It doesn't go deeper into hidden areas as freely as simple brushes. It take more time to clean teeth with this. One thing it does is gum massage due to vibration but prolonged use results into numbness. Practically I don't feel any extra advantage. It has 10 times less bristles fibres with 10 time more price. Best practice of brushing1. Pea size paste only.2. Brushing time = only till ""happy birthday"" song lasts. 1-1.5 minutes"
3.0,July,2021,negative,"Instead of a switch to on and off, they put in a mechanical arrangement, Which trips simply by any small shock like putting it back in the tray. Annoying and need to remove battery if I am travelling or it will keep vibrating while moving.Otherwise brush works fine. Battery life is low."
3.0,December,2021,negative,"It only vibrates when you press the button and as mentioned that top part of brush rotates, it doesn't. It makes a lot of noise but removes plaque, also takes a lot longer than normal brush to brush our teeth."

2.0,April,2023,negative,"It doesn't vibrate any longer. I changed batteries twice, but it just makes noise and doesn't really work any longer.Really upset."
3.0,March,2022,positive,Package delivered today.The product packaging was open. And the battery was installed.The Amazon team would have surely seen the open product..The brush works intermittently.

1.0,September,2023,negative,"The product started giving problem from the last 6 months and exactly after 1 year it has stopped working.Surprisingly, this product has no warranty and amazon is not aware of it.Don't purchase."
3.0,January,2017,negative,"Product is good and its a repeat purchase. Amazon did a good job since I am a prime member and delivered the product next business day. Seller Cloudtail shipped 2015 December made brush in 2017 January, that's just bad. I am keeping it, since its an unopened box. Also return policy is bad, the power toothbrushes cannot be returned!!!The brush's battery last for good amount of time, you can replace it with Duracell or something and it will last even longer. The brush head can be changed once in three months, its color changes as its life get over. The brushing experience is good, at least I am feeling like its doing a lot better than normal brushes. Kids above 5-6 can use it. I believe you will get soft heads if you want.Last but not the least. MRP is Rs.395, its falsely advertised here as of writing this review as Rs.595."
1.0,November,2023,negative,The toothbrush doesn’t charge ! After keeping it on charge for a few hours it only works 15 seconds and stops every single time. There is no light on the charger to know if it’s even charging or not. Absolute waste of money
3.0,October,2023,neutral,"This toothbrush dies just around weekend.No led or any indication of low battery, it just dies.Charging is slow but no indicator so you have to assume its charging.a good product ruined by charging and battery issues"
3.0,February,2024,positive,"Doesn't have any indicator for battery, is waterproof and motor is strong. More features could have been added at this price point. But for quality I would recommend."
3.0,January,2024,neutral,There is no charging indicator
2.0,February,2024,positive,Bought it in November 2023 and writing the review in Feb 2024. So yeah used it well before commenting.It’s a good electric tooth brush with 2 modes. Costlier compared to other available ones.Cons: no charging indicator. So you have no idea how many hours you need to chargeThe replacement heads cost rs.500 per pair and it lasts for 2 months.So the strategy is sell the brush at 1500 and charge 250 per month for replacement heads.Definitely wouldnt recommend.
2.0,December,2023,negative,"PROS: The toothbrush does it's basic job. Cleans well, gets into those hard to reach places and does make a an overall difference in hygiene. All this would be GREAT if the toothbrush actually WORKED. Read the cons and the final verdict.CONS: To say the battery life is pathetic would be an UNDERSTATEMENT. It BARELY lasts for two uses on a full charge, after which the power of motor is so low you might as well use a manual toothbrush. THERE IS NO LED INDICATOR LIGHT TO TELL YOU IF ITS CHARGED OR NOT. How long it takes to charge is literally anybody's guess. The charging base has a ridiculously tiny chord. And the base itself CONSTANTLY topples over. The icing on the cake is that after about a month, the toothbrush stopped charging altogether.FINAL VERDICT: EFFICIENT BRUSH WITH TERRIBLE BATTERY, TERRIBLE DESIGN, STOPPED WORKING AFTER A MONTH."
3.0,August,2023,negative,Toothbrush did a decent job of cleaning however it stopped working after a year of use.The only negative of the toothbrush is the lack of a charging light combined with a proprietary charger. If your battery is dead there's no way of telling if it's charging other than checking it after an hour or so
3.0,September,2023,neutral,"The modes are less compared to others on the market and the vibration that lets you know about the 4 quadrants is less noticeable against others. Also, there is no charging light indicator."
3.0,August,2023,negative,The electric brush has stopped working exactly after 1month of purchase!I want to get a replacement .yESTERDAY THE SELLER HAS GOT IN TOUCH WITH ME AND SUGGETED A VOUCHER IN LIEU OF REPLACEMENT WHICH I HAVE AGREED TO.AWAITING DEVELOPMENTS FROM THEM NOW.

Later i mailed them no reply. After paying this much amount it's too bad and I never expected an Oral-B-like product to be like this."

1.0,January,2024,negative,Poor product pls replace it if (seller) sees it
3.0,October,2021,negative,"Previously I used Oral B cross battery required brush for more than 2 years and planned to upgrade to this. This brush is expensive than B cross model. I saw many comments and details about rotating brushes with this model. Hence went for this.  However, the brush just twists a little bit like Oral B cross model and won't make any circular rotation. The replacement head is also expensive compared to B cross model. The rechargeable battery used in B cross model last me up to 2 months. This costly model will last up to 6 days with an in-built battery. The charging also requires 16 hours. Hence it will be inconvenient if the brush is dead before recharging. One needs to keep a  regular backup brush :-)I don't see much benefit in upgrading to this double-priced model versus my old B cross model."
2.0,September,2023,positive,"It works good but no display for chargingChanging ho raha hai ya nhi,pata nhi chalta. Bahut time to brush krte samay bich me hi band hota hai..need more facilities"
1.0,January,2024,neutral,No battery back don’t purchase this item and no return and refund policy
3.0,July,2022,negative,At ghist price the device and charger does not have led to indicate if the charger is working or the device button is On Or Off. If the battery dies and you put the device on charger and forget to turn off the device it will not charge and you will realize after 1 -2 hrs or if the charger is not working then know way to realize. In this age a led costs nothing and it is implied that a device will have such indicators. Either the designer were in experienced or oral-b wants u to waste your money
1.0,November,2023,neutral,I really hoped seller had put some picture of cord length and mentioned total length of cord. These things are necessary when you buying product online and that too with non refundable option.Also not sure why Amazon allowing almost everything in India as non refundable or very limited replacement window when we are paying almost equivalent of US prices for product.Oral b selling same product in US with charging cord almost 25% longer
3.0,June,2023,positive,Good power but misses led indicator while charging
3.0,May,2023,negative,It's not working whom should I contract?
3.0,November,2022,positive,"With an only positive that the brush head rotates, this is overpriced. This review is coming after 10 months of usage and changing the brush head once. Few cons: Poor battery life, no charging or battery status indicator, high priced brush heads, long charging time. Good option if you have extremely sensitive teeth. Else there are better options."
2.0,August,2023,positive,THIS IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED. THERE ONLY ONE BRUSH. THERE IS NO TIMING MECHANISM ON THE BRUSH. ONCE IT STARTS IT CONTINUES ON WITHOUT ANY STOP.

After going back through the other reviews i am disappointed i didn't read them first."

Works wellCleans well too ( I assume )But very very noisyCharge won't go beyond exactly 6 or 7 days ( my partner's realme sonic have passed a month with first charging, still working )No charging indicating light.No cover for the brush.Now Stopped working after 5 months.I won't recommend this, but this is the only rotating brush option at this budget.May be oral b higher versions may be good"

By the time this problem arose, Amazon couldn't help. Had to reach out to oral b customer support which is such a time taking process. Highly disappointed."
3.0,May,2021,positive,"No indication of charging or charged, no light or sound, so you don't know when it's fully charged. There is no protective cover for bristles. Battery life checked is good enough for 10 to 23 cycles. The other my previous model Cross Action with non chargeable Battery is much better on all respects and one AA battery is good for couple of months."
3.0,June,2021,negative,"It automatically turns on sometimes. Also, the charge wouldn’t last even for a second time use at times.Edit: Upon some Google searches, I realised that it is happening because somehow water has reached the circuit board causing the power button to act up. So, be careful while using the product.Except for this it is a wonderful brush."
2.0,October,2022,negative,"It's the most basic electric toothbrush. Doesn't charge well, there's no indicator to show less charge. It just abruptly stops. The charger doesn't have an indicator as well, you don't know if it's charging or not. Left it on charge for 12+ hours, only to realise it didn't charge at all, it's like throwing a dice and hoping for a 6. Not worth the price, there are better options from other brands"

2.0,May,2022,negative,"Hi Guys,Writing this review after using it for a month. I feel, overall it has good teeth cleaning ability. But what shocks me most is the battery life and charging indication. Battery life is around 10-15 mins on a single charge, which is low. There's absolutely no indication for charging. I must have broke my head 100 times to know whether the brush is getting charged. Even the charging instrument is poor.Recommendation: No. Better look for more advance toothbrush that has a better battery life and charging indicators."
1.0,August,2023,negative,DO NOT BUY THIS TOOTHBRUSH. This item does not recharge when you plug it in. Disgusting and pathetic product from Oral B.Amazon not ready to replace this product. Stick to Colgate. I will never by anything from Amazon again ??

2.0,July,2023,negative,"I bought this thinking it will last me and I won't have to charge it very frequently. However, I've to charge is at least once a week. I brush twice a day. In addition, in the manual, they've declared the maximum duration of this product is 2 years. That is, the battery will reach end of its life in 2 years. This is something they should've declared clearly when making the sale. It cleans well, but I am disappointed with the battery."

2.0,November,2020,negative,"This product is being introduced in indian market very late. Buying it is a gamble.Pros- Easy to use- Cleans the teeth way better than the manual wayCons- Manual suggests to keep it on charge always. Single charge takes ~16 hours. And stays for a week. Assuming brushing twice daily for 2 mins, that is mere 25 mins of backup.- No indicator when the battery is low, the brush just stops mid brushing. Gets difficult to track if you are traveling for long durations.- No indicator when put on charging. No usb charging support.- No protector for brush heads, feels unhygienic.- Brush heads are costly and often out of stock on Amazon.There are lot of reviews of people getting a defective product, and it is not returnable. Mine had battery issues from day one and stopped charging after one month of use. The service centers are very limited and getting the product repaired with them is a task in itself."

3.0,January,2023,negative,"This product is manufactured in China. I bought it, and the website has deliberately mentioned - Country of Origin- India. They should be punished."
2.0,December,2022,negative,I have been using since 12 days now but since the beginning the battery life is the worst. I tried charging it for 30mins & battery gets over not even half way to 2 minutes & when j charge it for more than 1 hour than only it stays for a whole 2 minutes & in the next usage it again drains out within 1 minute of usage. It's been this way since the start so I have to keep my regular toothbrush on hand to use if this one stops midway. Cleaning wise its good. But purchase it if you can keep it always on charging.
3.0,January,2023,negative,The charging stopped suddenly after use of 5 months.Need charger to be replaced
3.0,April,2023,positive,Too expensive
1.0,November,2023,neutral,It is not getting charged.  Product has become totally useless.  I noticed this before close of return window (26 October).  I couldn't get back as I was travelling.  Now I leave it to your good sense.
1.0,October,2023,negative,The purpose of brushing is not fully functionalIt doesn’t make you feel fresh and the feel of brushing is not at all there. The whole time you are worried about the liquid coming out from your mouth and the foaming is not at all Upto the mark..zero rating is not avl so I couldn’t give
1.0,December,2023,negative,Not able to charge the brush. Following all the instructions to charge the brush but still not able to charge the same.
1.0,November,2023,negative,The product stopped working within a month of purchase. Waste of money. Did not expect substandard product from Oral-B
1.0,December,2023,neutral,Only lasted 2 months stopped working don't buy
1.0,October,2023,negative,"The product has stopped working within 1.5 months of being delivered.At first I thought it might have discharged but even after charging it for full 24 Hrs,it didn't work.Highly disappointed with the brand!Also I am not getting the ways to claim for warranty."
2.0,June,2021,negative,"This product is being introduced in indian market very late. Buying it is a gamble.Pros- Easy to use- Cleans the teeth way better than the manual wayCons- Manual suggests to keep it on charge always. Single charge takes ~16 hours. And stays for a week. Assuming brushing twice daily for 2 mins, that is mere 25 mins of backup.- No indicator when the battery is low, the brush just stops mid brushing. Gets difficult to track if you are traveling for long durations.- No indicator when put on charging. No usb charging support.- No protector for brush heads, feels unhygienic.- Brush heads are costly and often out of stock on Amazon.There are lot of reviews of people getting a defective product, and it is not returnable. Mine had battery issues from day one and stopped charging after one month of use. The service centers are very limited and getting the product repaired with them is a task in itself."
1.0,October,2023,negative,Product is not working .but I have contacted Amazon service regarding replacement the item they are not responding properly and they don’t help me.this is worrest service of Amazon and product .guys don’t buy this items
1.0,June,2022,negative,"I have been using the product for a month now, and god it's awful!There are no indicators on when the battery life starts to get low. So every 4-5 days, the battery life will run out WHILE you are brushing your teeth, with all the foam in your mouth wondering what the hell exactly happened, scampering to find your old manual toothbrush to finish brushing for that day.And there are no indicators when you place the brush for charging, so you better pray to god almighty that it DID start charging, because more often than not, it won't, and when you pick up the brush the next day, still zero battery, so you adjust the brush and the charger a little bit and hope that it started charging THIS TIME, and so on.When you do find some luck and manage to charge your brush, it does a decent job and the 30 second timer ensure you don't over or under brushIt's unbelievable how such a shitty product has a 4+ rating on amazon, and how hard it is for Oral B to discontinue this and start a better model with some battery indicators. Feel like throwing this in the dustbin every other day and buying a better version. What a waste of moneySigh :("
3.0,March,2022,negative,Battery backup is only for 3-4 days &It should at least 1 brush head free with this price band.And its power button quality is also not good as expected And about freshness I will give 4.5 score out of 5
3.0,November,2021,positive,One thing I am disappointed from this is it's battery backup. It runs only 10- 12 minutes. Now depends how you use it. I like if it has more backup. Other wise very good product. It cleans my teeth completely which normal toothbrush can't do.
1.0,October,2023,neutral,Not even been 2 months and the brush has stopped charging. Like even after charging for entire day it dosent last even for 30 seconds ok total. Not even getting any help from customer service. Do not buy.

3.0,May,2022,positive,
3.0,July,2021,neutral,There is no charge indicator on the brush. Also no battery status indicator. So you have no means of knowing whether the brush is actually getting charged when plugged in. Also no way to see how much battery is left. The cord that comes with the charging station is very short.
1.0,November,2023,negative,"Stopped working in. 15days..,all the literature is in Chinese ...do not know whom to complaint..."
3.0,September,2020,neutral,For brushing my teeth. It is not to my expectations When the handle is on the charger there is no indication to show it is charging or not.

1.0,September,2023,negative,"Bad design- the area where the steel rod vibrates, has a gap which causes the tooth paste and other things from the brush to seep in which you can’t clean and it smells. Battery goes after 1.5 years and needs daily charging"

P & G IS STILL ASKING QUESTIONS AND SEEKING COPIES OF THE INVOICE AND ALSO PICTURES OF THE PRODUCT WHICH I HAVE ALREADY SENT THROUGH E-MAIL & WHATSAPP. STILL NO REMEDIAL ACTION TAKEN. P & G DOESN'T SEEM TO BE WORRIED ABOUT ITS OWN REPUTATION.PRODUCT WITH A VERY POOR/ IRRITATING BATTERY AND POOR CUSTOMER CARE.DON'T BUY.
1.0,October,2023,negative,Stopped working exactly after a month. Please don't prefer this product
2.0,December,2021,negative,I liked it a lot initially but got bored with it after using for a few months and went back to a regular brush. I guess one of the reason was how quickly it would get discharged and needed to be recharged and also the speed of the motor would slow down gradually after a full charge so there was no consistency in its performance which was a little dissapointing. But I did use it for more than 6 months so I guess I got my money's worth.
2.0,March,2023,positive,Product is good but Battery is not charging after 3 months of use

2.0,April,2022,positive,I bought this brush on 9th Nov & it is a very powerful brush. Worked really well till mid march. The battery ran out so as always put it on charge. Tried to use the brush after the charge was complete & it just wouldn't power on. Tried a few times but no luck. Kindly adviceon how to get it fixed as it has 2 yrs warranty!Thank you
2.0,May,2021,negative,"This brush does a great job of brushing. U can see the difference from first use. The biggest problem is battery charger. They recommend 16 hours of charging and u will have no idea whether it’s getting charged or not since u don’t have any light or indicator to know the battery. Secondly you should make sure u charge this before it gets drained completely. If u r using it and it gets drained out, u can’t charge it as it keeps getting discharged automatically since it’s in ‘on’ state. Less than 1 month of usage and I am already looking for service centres during lockdown period as the brush stopped working due to some charging issue"
3.0,September,2021,positive,The brush is quite good and does the job right but given the price segment a battery indicator should be included. Overall the product is nice and it's waterproof
1.0,September,2023,negative,"This is the worst product I ever buy, battery life is just 2-3 days and it stop.working after 3 months only."
1.0,May,2023,negative,Bought this product thinking Oral B being a global brand would make atleast an average product. But this is worse than that. Rotating brush head movements are violent and hurt your teeth and gums.I have bleeding gums because of this bad product.The mentioned features like 2 minutes timer and sensitive mode doesn't work at all.Absolutely hate it. 900 bucks down the drain.
3.0,August,2021,positive,Brushing teeth obviously. It is a good product but does not have a plugged-in or a fully - charged indicating light Which I feel is a must for all gadgets.

1.0,January,2023,negative,"Writting this review after 2 months of use. Brush worked fine for couple of uses when I bought it. But then when it's battery died I came to know about its wonderful feature- it's NON-EXISTENT BATTERY. When you charge it there is absolutely no way to know whether it's charging or not. Charge it for 1 hour and it's good for 1 use which lasts for hardly 2 mins. No wonder why they haven't given indicator, otherwise people would come to know about its horrible battery.Bought it even after reading similar issue in the comments, now regretting my decision. Money down the drain."
3.0,August,2022,neutral,Don't have a charging indicator :(
3.0,March,2021,positive,The brush is excellent at what it's supposed to do but like everyone was saying there could be an indicator to mention the charging and travel case would be the minimum thing one would expect after paying such premium price.
1.0,April,2023,negative,"The toothbrush was manufactured in 2021 and was over 15 months old when I received it, and it stopped working only after 4 days of use. Do not order from, ""Electronics Bazaar Store""; this is the worst seller on Amazon for knowingly sending old and bound to be defective products on Amazon. Seek other sellers instead, where chances would be that your product lasts longer."

As they mentioned in the discription there is a warranty of 1 year, I tried calling customer care and I was on the line for more then 30minutes and no one picked my call. I've been buying products from Amazon from more than 5 years but for the first time I'm highly disappointed by the product I received through Amazon. I bought this product after seeing so many good reviews and I'm writing this comment to share my experience with this product, which is really really worst. I would suggest don't buy this toothbrush, it's a total wastage of money."
3.0,September,2021,negative,Unable to understand whether or not it's charging. At least an indicator that the charger is plugged and charging is on is required.

My mother is old and does not understand things technically that much. When it discharged , she put it on charging but it never charges . It never worked again. There is no LED indicator in this brush as generally what I have seen in UK sold toothbrushes. So an user can never understand that it is even charging or not. When I called Amazon regarding this faulty brush , they simply said NO to take the product back and just my INR1200 lost in fraud. Avoid this toothbrush. Its not worth money."

Ofcourse this will be much better than a manual toothbrush butThe toothbrush feels like a kids toy in hand, the material finishing is really bad, the colourway is very awkward, the toothbrush is awkwardly very loud, despite the loudness the motor is not powerful enough to justify the noise. The battery is decent. A bit overpriced for 3k."
3.0,June,2023,positive,Everything is good. Just the noose is a bit loud for me. Some small drills are better sounding.
1.0,November,2023,negative,"as wonderful as this toothbrush is, giving a really lovely clean it’s design is seriously lacking in functionality. It becomes incredibly difficult to hold as you are cleaning your teeth and your hand and the toothbrush get a little bit wet. It’s slippery. Really annoying you have to keep stopping to dry, your hand and dry, the toothbrush.Far advanced performance in cleaning, than my older model pro 2000, but lacking in user functionality. The older models had a kind of rubber panel on them, which meant you could grip them throughout the whole clean and regardless of whether your hand was wet or dry.Overall, happy with the cleaning, but struggling to use it comfortably.Would not work for elderly people with arthritic and rheumatoid conditions."

,January,2022,positive,"Ok, die Bürste bürstet. Mehr soll sie ja nicht. Und das Licht, das an geht, wenn man zu feste andrückt, ist auch gut.Aber muss die Zahnbürste so laut sein? Man hat das Gefühl, man würde sich eine Bohrmaschine in den Rachen stecken!Außerdem hat diese Maschine unnötigerweise 3 Geschwindigkeiten, schnell, langsam, und sone Art Wellenbewegung, wie man sie eigentlich eher in Spielzeugen für Erwachsene vermutet. Wer braucht das?Und wenn man die Bürste ausschalten möchte, genügt nicht etwa ein Druck auf die Taste, sondern man muss 3 Mal drücken, denn mit jedem Druck schaltet man um einen der 3 Geschwindigkeiten weiter, sodass erst beim 3. Mal Stille herrscht.Zum Glück hält so eine Zahnbürste keine Ewigkeit, sodass ich diese jetzt ne Weile verwende, und mir dann ein anderes Modell besorge. Diese hier kann ich jedenfalls nicht uneingeschränkt empfehlen, außer man steht auf Bohrmaschinen im Hals oder adult toys ;)"

,August,2023,negative,"Die Einschaltung für die Zahnbürste ist total undurchdacht. Man muss ewig nach dem eingelassenen Druckpunkt suchen, dann reagiert er nicht immer beim ersten Mal und auch die etwas abgeschwächte Stärke ist noch ziemlich doll. (ich habe die weiche Bürste) Nachdem ich sie nicht mehr nehme, sind meine Zähne auch nicht mehr so empfindlich gegenüber kalten und warmen Speisen und Getränken. Ich hatte vorher eine ältere Version, die viel besser war. Schade um das Geld."
,November,2023,negative,Austaste geht extrem schwer
,July,2023,neutral,…ist aber sehr laut.
,February,2023,positive,"Ich war sehr zufrieden obwohl die Farbe nicht wie am Foto schimmert sondern nur babyblau ist. Exakt ein Jahr nach dem Kauf, ladete der Akku stolze 24 Stunden. 4 Tage später war er nach der 24 Std. Ladung trotzdem leer. Enttäuschend, dass das Produkt keine lange Lebensdauer hat."
,July,2022,negative,"Also, das Gute zuerst: Das ist meine erste elektrische Zahnbürste und ich kann es nur jedem empfehlen.Nun zur anderen Seite der Medaille und vielleicht sollte man einfach eine teurere Zahnbürste kaufen...Dieses ""Stocken"" alle 30sek, damit man weiß, dass man seit 30sek die Zähne putzt, ist einfach nur nervig und komplett überflüssig. Keine Ahnung wer auf so eine dumme Idee kam und schlimmer noch, es für eine gute Idee hielt...Auch nervig ist, dass der Akku halt einfach plötzlich leer ist und dann putzt die Zahbürste halt nur noch in so einer Art Sparmodus.Alles andere ist schon okay, so weit ich das beurteilen kann."
,October,2021,negative,"I bought this toothbrush because my old one was already extremely old and lost almost all power. This one is way more powerful, but comes with three different modes that you always have to cycle through whenever you want to switch the toothbrush on or off, which gets tedious and frustrating really fast, and these three different modes are also totally unnecessary. There is a high-power one, which is almost too strong, a less powerful one, which is basically perfect, and a weirdly pulsating one which makes no sense whatsoever.So it's basically just a gimmick to justify the price.I think that a cheaper basic one would actually be better."
,May,2023,negative,"Ich kann das Produkt nicht empfehlen. Man muss an den Vibrationspausen abzählen, ob man 2 Min geputzt hat. Keine Displayanzeige vorhanden. Auch putzt sie nicht wirklich gut. Man muss länger putzen, wenn man ein sauberes Ergebnis erzielen will. Kann ich nicht empfehlen."
,February,2023,positive,alles bestens
,August,2022,positive,"Die Akkulaufzeit ist inordnung. Es muss ca. 1x pro Woche nachgeladen werden(bei der Nutzung von zwei Personen). Die laustärke ist voll Unordnung. Das Reinigungsergebnis ist wirklich sehr gut, kein Vergleich zu einer “normalen“ Bürste. Es gibt mehrere verschiedene Bürsten und putzmodis. Der Nachteil ist, dass wenn alle bürsten haben möchte man nochmal mehr als den Kaufpreis dafür investieren muss."
,January,2023,negative,"Das ist nicht meine erste Oral-B Zahn, aber die schlechteste.Sie tut zwar, was sie soll, aber im Gegensatz zum Vorgänger, bei dem dem Akku die Puste auging - tauschen geht ja nicht - lag die alte sicher in der Hand. Da war im Griffbereich eine Gummierung. Beim Zähneputzen wird der Griff nun einmal naß, was bei der alten egal war, aber die neue rutscht aus der Hand. Deshalb rate ich vom Kauf dieser Zahnbürste klar ab."
,July,2022,negative,Dies ist meine 2. Oral B-Zahnbürste. Die erste hat nach vielen Jahren keine Akkukapazität mehr. Die neue hält länger als 2. Wochen. Allerdings ist die Vibration auch in der niedrigen Stufe sehr stark. Außerdem ist das Griffstück sehr glatt und nass/schaumbenetzt kaum zu halten.
,January,2022,negative,"Leider nicht für ältere Menschen brauchbar.Man benötigt einiges an Kraft in den Fingern um den Schalter zu betätigen und muss beim ein und ausschalten genau hinsehen um diesen auch wirkt zu treffen…Ich drücke mich morgens immer wundEigentlich ein Witz sowas an den Kunden zu veräußern, wer hat da in der Entwicklung geschlafen? Wurde das Produkt nicht Validiert?"
,January,2022,positive,"Sie liegt gut in der Hand und verfügt ueber mehrere Reinigungsstufen, die sehr angenehm sind. Bei zu viel Druck leuchtet sie rot auf. Akku Anzeige finde ich prima.Leider lässt sich die Zahnbürste nicht einfach  ausschalten. Man muss quasi mehrfach druecken, um die Reinigungsstufen zurück zu schalten, bis sie dann off ist. Wuerde mir deswegen dieses Modell nicht mehr kaufen."
,April,2022,negative,"Benutze seit Jahren elektrische Zahnbürsten von Oral-B. Musste mir jetzt leider Ersatz beschaffen und wurde nur noch enttäuscht.Der Akku dieses Handstückes taugt überhaupt nichts!!! Verprochen werden von Oral-B 14 Tage Nutzung bei voller Aufladung. Allerdings ging bereits nach 4 Tagen Nutzung am darauffolgendem Tag gar nichts mehr. Das bei ganz normaler Nutzung: 2x täglich 2 Minuten , voll aufgeladen. Dachte ich hätte nur ein fehlerhaftes Handstück erhalten.Habe durch Amazon sehr schnell eine Ersatzlieferung erhalten. Vielen Dank dafür.Aber auch bei diesem voll aufgeladenem Handstück ging nach 4 Tagen nichts mehr. Gaaanz miese Qualität.  Falsche Aussagen  und leere Versprechungen vom Hersteller.Auch musste ich feststellen, wie bereits andere Nutzer vor mir auch:wenn das Handstück nass wird,  ist es extrem glatt und rutscht. Die Gummierung ist im Gegensatz zu den Vorgängermodellen, extrem klein ausgefallen.  Auch ist der Ein- und Ausschaltknopf sehr schlecht zu ertasten. War bei meinem alten Modell von Oral-B viel besser.Geht auch zurück. Keine Kaufempfehlung!!!"
,May,2022,negative,"Der an und aus Knopf geht relativ schwer …bzw. man muss oft darauf drücken, um den richtigen Punkt zu treffen …vielleicht bedarf es auch etwas Übung ??"
,April,2023,negative,"Aus gutem Grund habe ich keine Ultraschallzahnbürste gekauft, sondern eine mechanische - und war bislang mit Oral B auch gut gefahren. Der Ton der Oral-B PRO 3 3000 CrossAction ist allerdings so hochfrequent, dass ich das Gerät als unbenutzbar empfinde. Außerdem scheinen die Bürsten auch nicht komplett auf dem Antrieb zu haften. Es gibt immer wieder ""Stottergeräusche"". Blöderweise habe ich die Zahnbürste erst nach Ablauf der Rückgabefrist ausprobiert."

,July,2022,negative,Nicht zu empfehlen... Keine Möglichkeit die Garantie hier in Anspruch zu nehmen und Amazon zu kontaktieren
,November,2021,negative,Die Produktverpackung war bei Erhalt schon ziemlich ramponiert / abgegriffen/ an den Kanten abgestoßen. Offensichtlich handelt es sich um ein gebrauchtes Gerät. Das ist bei einer Zahnbürste absolut ekelhaft. Wurde retourniert!

,September,2021,positive,"Bon je vais être très franche c'est la 1iere fois que je suis déçue par une brosse à dents électrique Oral B.  Certes elle brosse bien les dents  et  elle est très simple d'utilisation ça au moins c'est validé  mais très franchement je la trouve désagréable à l'usage. Elle est  hyper bruyante et elle vibre énormément même en mode douceur,  se laver les dents avec pour moi n'est pas agréable,  sans parler du minuteur de 2 minutes qui est imperceptible...J'aurais préféré qu'elle s'arrête au bout de 2 minutes. Seul le capteur de pression par son signal visuel rouge est probant ainsi que son autonomie.Alors à acheter en connaissance de cause si le bruit n'est pas un facteur dérangeant pour vous et que vous recherchez avant tout la simplicité allié à l'efficacité ce modèle sera donc le bon pour vous ;-)"
1.0,March,2023,negative,"If it is being shipped to India, the least they can do is to give a charger for 220V.  My charger stopped working in seconds.  Only when I looked at the rating closely it says 100-150V"

,on,27,positive,"Update #2: I know the Pro 1500 isn't on Oral-B's website. When I bought the Pro 1500 nearly a year ago, I asked Oral-B why it's not on their site because I was concerned I had just bought a discontinued product. They assured me that it was in fact a brand new item that they had just released and that they were going to add the Pro 1500 to their site ""soon"".I realize that it's nearly a year later and they still haven't done it even though they are still manufacturing it, but I have been to their site several times per month since then and I can tell you that I'm honestly not surprised it's not on their site yet. I get the impression that anyone could do a better job with their site up-keep than whoever is doing it now. I have even noticed that it's kinda somewhat falling apart. Some elements no longer work and haven't worked for months. Their products are fine, they just need better people to handle and operate their website.Update #1: When I wrote this review, the price was the same for the Pro 1000 and Pro 1500 (including both the black and white Pro 1000s). Today, the price for the Pro 1500 nearly $20 more than it was when I wrote this review, and currently close to $30 more than the Pro 1000.[Original review below]I bought this to replace a very new Vitality. It was a *HUGE* upgrade over the Vitality, but then I saw the Pro 1500 and learned from Oral-B that it's quite superior. The Pro 1000's specs are:- 1 cleaning mode: Daily Clean- 8,800 oscillations per minute and 20,000 pulsations per minute on the Daily Clean mode- A pressure sensor that's supposed to just stop the pulsations when it's triggered- A pro timer that hesitates the motor once every 30 seconds, and 3 times every 2 minutes- A NiMH battery (old technology)- A battery life of 28 minutes (7 days, 2 minutes per day 2 times per day)- A full recharge time of 22 hours- A green charge indicator LED that blinks while charging, but stays off when it's not charging- A red battery level indicator that blinks a few times upon on/off if the battery needs to be charged- The CrossAction brush headThe Pro 1500's specs are:- 2 cleaning modes: Daily Clean and Sensitive- 9,900 oscillations per minute and 45,000 pulsations per minute on the Daily Clean mode (these speeds are faster than any I've seen so far in the specs of any of Oral-B's electric toothbrushes, including the Genius 8000 - they all seem to top out at 8,800 oscillations per minute and 40,000 pulsations per minute)- 7,400 oscillations per minute and 33,000 pulsations per minute on the Sensitive mode- A pressure sensor using a red LED that turns on when the pressure sensor is triggered- A pro timer that hesitates the motor once every 30 seconds, and 3 times every 2 minutes- A Lithium Ion battery- A battery life of 56 minutes (14 days, 2 minutes per day 2 times per day)- A full recharge time of 12 hours- A green charge indicator LED that blinks while charging, but stays off when it's not charging- A red battery level indicator that blinks a few times upon on/off if the battery needs to be charged.- The CrossAction brush headThe Vitality is extremely basic:- 1 cleaning mode: Daily Clean- 7,600 oscillations per minute.- A timer that hesitates the motor 3 times every 2 minutes- A NiMH battery- A battery life of 20 minutes (5 days, 2 minutes per day 2 times per day)- A full recharge time of 19 hours- No charge indicators or battery life indicators- Mine came with the Sensitive Gum Care brush headIn comparison, the Vitality seems like a cheap generic electric toothbrush. Don't consider buying it.When I upgraded to the Pro 1000, it was amazing. I wanted to burst at the seams and write an extremely rave review, but then I learned about *and ordered* the Oral-B Pro 1500. After using it, I can tell you that the Pro 1500 is *FAR* better than the Pro 1000. I honestly feel the Pro 1000 should be discontinued and no one should ever buy it. I mean really, the Pro 1500 is only $10 more right now and it destroys the Pro 1000.I would have given the Pro 1000 4 stars instead of just 3 if it had a Lithium Ion battery. They charge faster and last longer without charging.So yeah, I am not sure I would recommend the Pro 1000 if you can get the Pro 1500. The Pro 1500 is a much wiser purchase. I'm *extremely* happy with mine. It blows the Pro 1000 out of the water."
,on,22,positive,"I had a Philips Sonicare for many years, that recently died. I bought this toothbrush primarily for the oscillating motion, since that's what dentists use (I literally had the thought as a child, ""why don't our toothbrushes look like the dentist's?""). After using this Oral-B for a few days, I'm glad I bought it, but I also hate it.I hate that it *stutters* when it's time to switch tooth quadrants, vs the Sonicare that makes a gentle change in pitch. I hate that it doesn't stop after going through four quadrants, that it just stutters harder, and you have to turn it off manually (unlike the Sonicare). I hate that the noise is louder and harsher than the Sonicare. I hate that there is only one button, so you will always have to press it at least four times total during brushing in order to turn it off. I hate that I can't tell the difference between the brushing modes at all (the pitch seems to go *down* slightly when cycling, so is the first mode the strongest? I can't tell. Only thing I can tell is that the third setting seems to vary in velocity, which, why?). I REALLY hate that the instructions refer to it as type 3757, and in every distinct section of the instructions it never refers to that type number, but it does consistently refer to three *other* type numbers, leaving me totally in the dark on this toothbrush's functionality (particularly what the different brushing modes are, if they are different). I hate that it claims, on this very Amazon page, that there is a pressure sensor, but as hard as I press absolutely nothing changes (unlike the Sonicare); AND the instructions specifically say that the pressure sensor is only for type 3791. I also hate that the battery life is allegedly significantly worse than the Sonicare (supposedly one week only for the Oral-B, and I used to get a month on one charge brushing twice a day with the Sonicare).All that being said, it is more aggressive, and the oscillating motion does feel more thorough. In short, my teeth definitely feel cleaner after brushing with this vs the Sonicare. That plus the fact that brushheads are cheaper means I will stick with this even though I hate it. I'd advise others to consider a more expensive model if they address any of these myriad annoyances I've found."
,on,3,negative,"I have used a different brand for years, but my dentist suggested I try an Oral B because it does as good a job and the brush heads (and in this case, also, the unit itself) are less expensive. He noted that the round brush head is easier to get into the molars all the way in the back. He especially recommended an Oral B because it is supposed to stop if you apply too much pressure.Well, it turns out I do like the small brush head a lot, and I don't  mind the noisiness of the Oral B. (My other brand emitted a tone--I think it was the B below middle C--that I enjoyed harmonizing with while I brushed, but never mind that!)  But I also have some disappointments:1) Maybe I got a bad unit, but I am astonished by how often it needs recharging--every few days, it seems. (I may call Oral-B tomorrow to ask about this.) Other reviews, I think, claimed that it held its charge for a long time.2) The brush does not stop pulsing if I apply too much pressure, as it is supposed to do. I have tried to make it stop, just to verify.3) The integrated button on the handle is not as responsive to the touch as I would like.  It requires more effort to shut it off than it should.4) I have no idea how to access the ""3 EASY-TO-USE CLEANING MODES."" Usually these things strike me as so much baloney, so that's not a make-or-break for me.(Also: I wish it came with a case.)It is not an expensive  model, and I don't need all the bells and whistles (bluetooth??!!). I am mostly irritated by the need to recharge it often."
,on,18,negative,"I’ve used Oral-b toothbrushes for quite a while and I have always liked them. After my last one died (it had lasted almost ten years) I was looking for something new but didn’t want to pay a lot. I settled on this one after looking at the pros and cons of the different models. It is much like the other models I have had with a couple of exceptions. First it doesn’t beep at each 30-second mark. Instead it pulses. Even after using it for six months I’m always thinking I’ve missed the pulse. The second issue is a bigger one. The toothbrush is supposed to have a pressure sensor that stops the brush if you press to hard against your teeth. I’ve tried and I can’t seem to get that to work.Oh, and I really like the color of the toothbrush. The black stands out nicely. However it seems to be impossible to find black replacement brushes so as soon as you need to change the head you move into the two-tone-toothbrush mode.So mixed review from ne on this one. Oral-b is a great toothbrush but I might have been better off spending a little more on a better model."
,on,5,positive,"The feature ratings are- Deep Cleaning: 5- Timer Function: 3- Bluetooth connectivity: 1I'll address those in turn, then address the title.Deep Cleaning: jeez is this thing effective. You have two different intensities, depending on how hard you press the brush against your teeth. I use it in tandem with a rigorous flossing routine and a hard bristle brush for large debris removal. It offers a genuinely clean feeling (like I just got out of the hygienist's chair) most of the time, with me just paying mind to the timer.Timer Function: you'll get a hard-to-miss vibration every 30 seconds. One ""play"" of this sequence for every quadrant of your mouth to guide your cleaning, with the fourth being more pronounced, to tell you ""you're done"" (with the dentist recommended 2-minutes of brushing). It's solid but has significant shortcomings.1. If you stop brushing before you finish the cycle-of-4 (or if you brush for longer), the brush isn't smart enough to know that. There doesn't seem to be an internal ""smart reset"" mechanism, and there is no means of manually triggering such except to let the brush run and to turn it off as soon as you hear/feel the 4th-cycle pattern.2. There are occasions when the brush seems to be smart enough to detect *something* about restart the *count* to 4, but it doesn't reset the 30-sec timer. That's just strange.So why 3 stars? Because I've bought cheaper tooth brushes that are more consistent (e.g. just turning off the motor after the cycle-of-4) with their timers' behavior. This one does more, but inconsistently, and was more expensive. 3 star value for 3 star functionality.Bluetooth: functionality doesn't exist. No idea what they're talking about.The Title: why do I ""hate"" it? Water capture. Water, and tooth-pasty saliva, get caught in the weirdest places in this brush, such that I can rarely complete a brushing without much of it trickling down my hand, wrist, and arm. Might I also mention that I have to store the brush head on a towel, so the trapped water will flow out in a managed space, rather than caking (e.g.) the brush with tooth-pasty water spots? The only mitigation I've found is a near-constant inhalation as means of suctioning the moisture to stay in my mouth. This is the first electric toothbrush with which I've had this problem. The dripping effect varies from brush head to brush head (which need to be swapped rather often, especially if you are undergoing orthodontia) which suggests a manufacturing quality-control issue.I would not buy it again, knowing this is what I was getting into. I wish it wasn't the case, because you can tell they tried to make something quality, but effort and execution are different things.If someone could prove to me that it's just faulty hardware or my poor technique, I would gladly improve the rating."
,on,9,negative,"It’s hard to adjust the various settings. Lots of noises and vibrations make brushing a bad experience. It jerks to tell the user to change quadrant. The on off button is supposed to control the various brushing actions but really don’t notice any difference from one setting to the other.  It seems like it never turns off unless you turn it off. How anyone is able to time brushing from quadrant to another beats me. It seems to clean your teeth but it’s not a pleasant experience. I guess like anything else it takes time to get used to this thing and understand its limited functions. For a device that has been around for many years I am not impressed with this poorly engineered electric toothbrush.  I also have a Sonicare electric toothbrush and it’s far more sophisticated and user friendly. Buy a waterpik to get between your teeth, floss daily, use a good mouthwash, and use good old fashioned tooth brush."
,on,8,positive,I bought this one as a travel electric toothbrush.  It works ok but does not have the deep cleaning that my Phillips electric toothbrush does.  When I press hard on the Oral B it stops the brush.  I also do not care for the press the on off button three times to turn it off.  The brush goes from fast to slow then off.  All in all it was much cheaper than the Phillips and is perfect for travel.  If it were my one and only I would return.
,on,28,positive,"Hello! I loved this toothbrush, it did an amazing job and I always felt so clean after each use.  Until I started to notice it wouldn’t turn on the first time pressing the bottom and one day it completely stopped working. I’ve been told that they can last 5+ years but I only used mine for about 2 years before it completed stopped turning on. Is there a way I can receive a refund or receive a new one? Please and thank you!"
,on,11,negative,It's a nicely looking toothbrush with polished handle.  Which makes it very slippery and difficult to use when it naturally becomes wet.  It supposed to have some additional features like timer etc. which don't work properly. If you need a basic model - go for Oral-B Pro 500.  If you need more advanced features - go for higher end model.  Either way there is no reason to buy this one.
,on,12,negative,Compared to my last electric toothbrush this thing is loud and the vibrations are really rough. Seems to do the job though. Also there is a plug in stand for it that’s a pain. My last one didn’t have a stand and you could charge it off a little usb cord. Much more convenient. Expected more from Oral B.
,on,16,positive,Not high quality but it gets the job done. Not sure how long it will last as I’ve only had it about a month. Not good to compare to a high dollar toothbrush but you only have to hold it so it’s good enough. Will  spend more money on the next one I get.
,on,9,positive,"For the money it is good. The battery life is poor. You need to keep this on the charger or in 12 hours battery would be weak. Also, very difficult to shut off. I purchased several months ago but now looking for one that is higher quality."
,on,7,positive,"It’s a good product, definitely cleaned my teeth better than a regular non-electric toothbrush. However, I bought a black toothbrush and got sent a blue one instead, which is troublesome since my roommate has the exact same one. It’s annoying but I’m too lazy to return anyway…"
,on,25,positive,"Love the toothbrush but it has a very bright and large green blinking light when charging, which lights up the bathroom and adjacent bedroom at night. You’ll need to close the door to the bathroom or use an eye mask."
,on,21,negative,"I ordered this after using a spinbrush with rechargeable AA batteries for several years, and then using some cheapo sonic toothbrush for a while. I thought it would be great in comparison due to Oral B being an actual brand and it being fairly expensive.Wow was I wrong. Reasons I hate this thing and am getting rid of it:1. I don't know if it's my mouth shape, brushing technique, or what, but this thing always tends to drip along the back and I always end up with a gross trickle of toothpaste-spit on my hand and on the handle.2. The controls are dumb. It has 3 different speeds. Even the cheap generic sonic brush I had would remember your last speed and just default to that. I'd click to turn it on, click to turn it off. You could change speed by double clicking. Great! But not this POS. You have to cycle through all the speeds every time. You can at least turn it off by holding down the button for a couple of seconds, but COME ON. WHY? Really dumb controls.3. The battery only lasts less than 2 weeks, brushing 2x per day. That seems really short? My previous 2 brushes were weeks, maybe months, between recharging. Minor inconvenience, but still annoying that after a week the thing is already slowing down. I could have left it on a charger all the time but I like my vanity to be tidier than that, and don't think I should have to have a cable management system for a gd toothbrush.Anyway, I left it 2 stars because it's a working electric toothbrush, but I'm tempted to give it a 1. Will not be buying replacement heads, or any other oral b toothbrush ever again."
,on,7,negative,"The plastic rib on the power unit (handle) that is supposed to hold the brush head body steady wears quickly.  When this happens, the bristles do not rotate (oscillate) as they should, even though the motor runs properly.  Instead, the brush head body itself turns, while the bristles move only a little, or not at all.  I have tried inserting a metal shim in the slot between the plastic rib and the ""keyway"" in the brush head, but this gives at best a weak, temporary improvement.  Changing out the brush head for a brand new one does nothing to improve the action."
,on,28,negative,"I'd read some comments about how loud this toothbrush is, but, I figured, how loud can it be? The answer is TOO LOUD! I've had probably 10 different electric toothbrushes in the last 20 years, and this is easily the loudest. It's obnoxious!Also, the charge lasts only about a week, and that's too short a time for my use. If you are able to keep it on the charger all the time, that probably doesn't matter.I do like the round head. That shape makes more sense to me than others, which is why I switched.When I buy my next toothbrush, which will be soon, I'll get another Oral B, but it'll be one with a much lower decibel rating."
,on,27,positive,The brush cleansing part works very well however the on/off switch never works correctly. I am always pressing multiple areas to hit the right spot to turn on AND off.
,on,4,negative,After a month the battery seems losing  Harte capability. I have to charge twice a week instead  once. The head brush bristles starting opening sooner than expected.
,on,7,positive,Toothbrush is ok…. Was hoping for a little more power. It stalls out if too much pressure applied… might be a safety feature….
,on,15,negative,"I previously had a sonicare electric toothbrush, so maybe I’m biased but this Oral B isn’t my favorite. I went with it because I thought I should try something new (and my Sonicare died after 3-4 years). It gets the job done; my teeth are probably clean. However, it’s loud, the toothbrush head is too big for my mouth so I have to keep my mouth open and toothpaste is falling out everywhere (it is hilarious to watch tho), and it feels cheaper overall. I’m told that there are “compact” brush heads, but I’ve been looking and I can’t find that description anywhere; however that could be on me. Also I think there is a timer, and it buzzes every 30 seconds. It doesn’t turn off after 2 minutes, so I’m a little confused by that feature. I’m a bit picky for sure, but I wouldn’t recommend this. :/"
,on,18,positive,"It cleans my teeth great, and for that I love it! But it is so so loud!!"
,on,24,negative,"This toothbrush gets my teeth clean after every time I use it. I can tell it massages my gums when I am brushing my teeth. I can't really tell when it lets me know that I am brushing too hard on my teeth, maybe when it vibrates. I wish it would turn off and let me know that 2 minutes is up after I had brushed my teeth. I find it very annoying that I have to press the off button 3 times in order to turn off the toothbrush. lastly, I don't like how I have to keep on charging it in several days, now that can be very annoying, but overall, a nice toothbrush to have."
,on,27,negative,This is not a toothbrush that you can use if others are sleeping. It's noisy.
,on,1,positive,"Love this and the color, however I have to charge it every 2 days."
,on,5,negative,"This was my first electric toothbrush and I definitely feel like it cleans my teeth better than I do manually. However, the battery life on this isn’t very long compared to similar products and you may have to spend a lot more time brushing than manually. It’s also extremely loud and I mean very very loud!!! The noice is the main part the company needs to improve on. Otherwise this toothbrush is a decent buy."
,on,30,negative,"The brushing is just fine, and I guess that's the important thing, but the recessed on/off button is difficult to locate by feel, even more difficult to turn on, and more difficult still to turn off. I have to use my thumbnail to exert enough force even after I find the thing. My old Spinbrush had two raised buttons, a large one for on, a smaller one for off. Very easy to find and operate. Perhaps my old arthritic thumb is the problem, but I bet there are a lot of folks with the same issue. I find it annoying enough that I may have to pass it on to another family member and go back to an easier to use model."
,on,18,negative,Variable speed is poor.
,on,4,positive,I bought this based on all the positive reviews. I was used to a Phillips and thought I would give it a try. I like it far less than the Phillips. Its a very aggressive and loud toothbrush. In fairness it seems like it cleans really well but I do not enjoy brushing with it at all. My entire head shakes when I use it.
,on,12,negative,"I enjoyed the product from may 2019 to November 2023. Yesterday the battery stopped charging. Green light flashed quickly and battery doesn't fill up so the toothbrush no longer works. The warranty period is for 2 years only, so that's that. That's what I will expect from my next toothbrush. Not a long-term investment but it's 40 bucks so still probably cheaper than what I would have spent on manual toothbrushes over the course of 5 years. Disappointed I can't do anything to fix it. Will find a place to hopefully recycle the parts."
,on,19,positive,"It is small and lightweight, but I am regretting buying it. My hands are somewhat stiff from arthritis and when it gets wet, it slips from my hand. Anyone with  normal function of the hands should be very happy with this. The price is good."
,on,8,negative,"This toothbrush didn't work as well as expected. Hard to turn on and off, loud and runs slower then a $10 grocery store battery operated brush. The shipping box was battered as well as box the toothbrush came in...would not recommend. It was a bought as a gift??"
,on,12,neutral,"En la descripción dice q tiene temporizador y sensor para evitar cepillado duro, pero no hace nada de eso. A parte del color no veo diferencia con un cepillo electrónico sencillo"
,on,21,negative,"I thought I was buying a toothbrush with a timer on it - apparently not or it doesn't work.The toothbrush is excessively noisy - like a car without a muffler.However, it does do a good job of cleaning"
,on,24,negative,Pressure indicator is not visual and to be honest is imperceptible. I wish I did not buy it as pressure indicator of my brushing was the main reason I bough this.
,on,10,negative,Works well but it’s so loud! I had a different electric toothbrush prior to this one and it was significantly quieter than this one.
,on,20,negative,"To turn off this toothbrush I have to push the off button 3 times. Now that may have something to do with the mode you're in at the time...but as soon as I push button to come on, it's always in the same fast, uncomfortable mode (bangs my teeth around no matter how lightly I hold it against surface of teeth) AND as others have noted, it IS loud.  -- Am returning"
,on,18,negative,The handle has no anti slip material - so I’m constantly dropping the toothbrush - not sure why they made it like this - not user friendly!
,on,26,negative,I have arthritis in my hand and it is hard to turn off. I turn it off before taking it out of my mouth or it splatters everywhere. My previous electric toothbrush was easier to use. The brush head is also bigger than I am used to.
,on,29,negative,Liked the item. Had a problem. Went to website looking for help. The whole website is about sales of oral b products. Used phone number on website and got more sales talk. No help with the problem.
,on,11,positive,"I don’t need or want all the bells and whistles (or high price) of the higher end Oral-B rechargeable electric toothbrushes found at Costco and online. This brush effectively gets the job done and came at a good price (under $40).My only issue is the power button. A simple press will turn on the brush, but I need to press firmly for two seconds to turn it off."
,on,13,negative,"Not much to like for me. This toothbrush is very loud and rough. And my teeth don't feel as clean as they did with my old cheap sonic one. The on/off switch is awkward to use (the button isn't easy to push and you need to push it 4 times to turn it off). It doesn't hold a charge very long (yes, we charged it for 24 hours before using). I don't like the charging stand- I prefer a separate small charger that plugs into the bottom (and only needs charged every 2 weeks). The final straw is it only came with one head, and the 3-head package at the grocery store was $30 which my husband bought before we realized how much we hated the toothbrush. The only potential upside is that some reviewers say this one lasts for years (not helpful if you don't like it) and the sonic ones seem to die after a year and a half."
,on,5,negative,This product lasted only two years and they suddenly stopped charging so is useless now.  Looks like it was just over a month outside the dates for the product support window.
,on,5,negative,"I've had many oral B toothbrushes. This is a basic model that functions very well, but the signature quality feel and appearance is missing. This just looks and feels cheap."
,on,5,negative,The button is hard to push in to turn on
,August,2023,negative,"I finally decided to try out an electric toothbrush, hummed and hawed before figuring I should go with the cheap version (just in case I hated it!)The cheap version (or older model if you want to be specific) makes brushing those hard to reach spots so much easier. I am still adjusting to using less pressure and get warning buzzes on the daily to relaxI find brushing my teeth 2x daily sees this thing going on the charger every 4 or so days, basically twice a week. I feel like it takes a long time to charge too, if I plug it in in the morning it only finishes charging around supper time. If you’re homebody it’s merely a nuisance but if you go somewhere do not forget that charging stand!I saw some other reviews before purchasing that describe it as pretty noisy, to be clear it vibrates so loudly that I am pretty sure my neighbours think I am busy with other activities…Overall I like it, it does the job, but I do wish I had gotten a new model to test out with a longer battery lifeSo if you’re debating between this and a new(er) model, spend the extra bit of money and go newer!"
,on,25,negative,I feel like this bad boy is constantly trying to slip out of my hand due to it's cylindrical shape. I wish it was built with a better material or more ergonomic shape to make it easier to hold onto.
,on,5,positive,battery life only one week.
,on,15,negative,This brush works well once on but I have a very hard time turning it on and off. It is like the power switch is indented. I wish I had returned it as it drives me crazy that it is so difficult to turn off in the middle of brushing (or when done).
,January,2024,negative,"I had the Oral-B Pro 3000 for 3 years before it broke (dropped it) and it was the perfect Oral-B.Decided to purchase this model since it was on sale. I absolute hate the feel of it because of the material. It has a shiny coating on the plastic all around, making it a little bit slippery when brushing your teeth since you mostly are in a wet environment (the 3000 model has a rubbery silicone outer layer and the grip was outstanding).Also, the ''On'' button is inward (concave) and doesn't really click when pressing it, so you have to press a little bit harder than usual to have a response (the 3000 ''On'' button was outward (convexe) and it clicked, making it way way more easy to turn it off when needed).If you are planning to use it everyday, get the 3000 model (I also use a Sonicare, so I will probably keep this model until the 3000 model is on sale). The only good thing is that it uses the Oral-B rotation technology, so it will still clean your teeth thoroughly !"
,on,30,positive,"It’s a nice model, but the brush is definitely not soft, and a bit on the large size. Brushing is noisy."
,November,2023,neutral,"Owned for 8 months.Generic electric toothbrush, no way to disable the 30 second notifier to switch quadrants while brushing which can be annoying.Battery is OK, but a full charge takes way too long.The base that holds brush head on the body is starting to come off, product was well taken care of, sort of a shame to see but maybe just unlucky with mine."
,June,2023,neutral,"Mine sounds like a remote control airplane when it starts up. I am pretty sure my neighbours can hear it when I turn it on (awkwarrrrrd, I am brushing my teeth, yall. I promise! lmao). Also think it's important to note, it's just a high-powered vibrating brush, it's not actually spinning from what I can tell - I didn't read the description that well so for people who skip descriptions and go for reviews, you're not buying what you think you're buying. I see why it was so cheap now. That being said, it looks nice, and it does still offer a deeper clean than a standard toothbrush. I also don't know what any of the settings or lights or anything are doing, because I didn't read the instructions.  I'm saying that because it's not a plug-and-play thing. You'll need to read the instructions to know how to use that toothbrush and that's more effort than I am looking to put into my toothbrush. Still, if you're on a budget and need a deeper clean - this is your sign to buy!"
,on,18,negative,"Have had Oral B electric toothbrushes for forever.  They are terrific and my dentist is consistently thrilled with my check-ups.  That being said, my toothbrushes died recently.  They were 8 years old.  Purchased 2 new ones and find the ""on/off button"" is amazingly difficult to engage.  WTH?  Both my husband and I are having the same problem so it isn't operator error.  The on buttons are terribly unresponsive.  You have to really push your nail directly into the center of the button for to turn on (or off) and that usually takes several tries.  Will need to see if I can return.  I stupidly threw the boxes out assuming Oral B would provide a superior product.  Buyer beware!"
,on,16,positive,"The brush works great, even though it's a little louder than the my old Sonicare.I took stars off because, afte revery use, you need to remove the brush head to rinse the toothpaste out of the connection ring, and inside the head itself. For some reason, there is a hole in the neck of the brush, right under the bristles, where that will fill and get moldy & crusty if not rinsed out after every use."
,on,13,negative,"Good for the price, but there are sacrifices. Though I'm sure it's getting my teeth clean, it seems as loud as a tractor and is hard to turn off using just one hand."
,on,7,positive,Wish this had a timer on it
,on,25,negative,Was broken and felt cheap out of the box
,on,1,positive,It was just ok
,February,2024,negative,My elderly mother has problems turning it on and off. Very cheap power button mechanism.
,on,8,negative,"I’ve used the original Braun rechargeable toothbrush for years. I purchased this model because I felt I should buy a new one.Although I like the way my teeth feel after brushing,I was disappointed that the features advertised“ The pressure sensor stops the pulsation movement if you brush too hard and the in handle timer helps you brush for a dentist recommended 2 minutes3 modes (Daily Clean, Whiten, and Sensitive) to break up and sweep away plaque” do not apply to this model. Also it’s so difficult to shutoff. I do need two hands to shut it off.I’m not sure how the battery charge will be since I only have it a short time.I hope this information helps ."
,December,2023,positive,Decent but next time will spend the money for better quality and feel.
,on,25,negative,"After using a Sonicare for years, I decided to see what was regarded as the best out there currently as a replacement.  The Oral-B was rated #1 on several of the sites I looked at so I went for it.  The biggest take away is the battery life is terrible.  Also, the charging time is terrible.  With the Sonicare, I didn't keep the toothbrush on the base unless it needed a charge.  Even after 10+ years with the same unit, I'd have to charge it maybe twice a month.  With this Oral-B, it starts dragging after 5 days max.  I stick it on the charger before going to bed and find it's not fully charged in the morning.  When it is fully charged, it works fine.  I wouldn't say there's any noticeable step-up from the Sonicare with it.  But with the battery life/charging situation, I'll likely be replacing it with something else soon."
,on,28,negative,"""I'm not sure if I received a defective product, but the battery life of this toothbrush is disappointing, especially given its price. I bought it as a replacement for another electric brush that no longer offers replacement heads. Despite charging it overnight, I find that it only lasts a single day before needing to be recharged, even though I only brush twice a day. It's puzzling because I'm not leaving it on all day or using it continuously. Additionally, it's quite noisy and feels somewhat outdated. In my opinion, there are better and more affordable options available."""
,on,27,neutral,Circular brush cleans well but it's bulky particularly in back of the mouth. I preferred the fit of my previous electric brush with smaller rectangular head.
,on,3,negative,I love the oral B but I have to charge it every couple of days .  It's very inconvenient
,on,27,negative,"Since toothbrush has no real grip, it gets hard to hold onto in use. Slippery. Old version was matte and grippier."
,on,16,negative,The on/off switch is indented and not a button above surface. I have arthritis and this makes it very difficult to operate. Other than that I no other complaints.
,on,8,positive,"Toothbrush was amazing for about 30 days.  Then all of a sudden, it stopped working.  Is there any way to get an exchange?  $50 is a lot to spend for a toothbrush! Edit:  The return window had just closed about a week earlier, but I was able to contact Amazon Customer Service and I asked them to allow the return, and they did.  I do love the toothbrush.  It does a great job."
,on,24,negative,"As others have said, the actual toothbrush is great, but the on off button is stupid and hard to push"
,October,2023,negative,"Useless battery life. After a night recharge, you still cannot use it for more than 5 times (2 days) before it drops dead. Such battery life is very inconvenient compared to other brands such as Philips which I had for 4 years."
,July,2023,negative,"I purchased this brush after having a Sonicare brush for several years.  I wanted to try the round brush head and I like the brush head a lot - for me, it is better for cleaning back teeth and seems to do a very good job.  However, the bush is very noisy - to the point of being irratating first thing in the morning.  I also find the stem of the brush to be quite large and therefore more uncomfortable in my mouth and also messier.  Although I will keep this brush for travel or a spare, I will buy another for everyday use - probably going back to Sonicare as they are far less noisy.  Sorry, Oral B - if you can make them quieter and with a thinner stem, then this would be the perfect brush"
,October,2023,positive,Not thrilled with the tooth brush - replaced my old one which I loved and was the same brand . On /off button seems to stick on this one making it harder to turn on and off  ??
,November,2023,positive,I like the toothbrush but it stalls occasionally during use.It is also a bit noisier than I expected.It does good job on cleaning teeth.
,on,10,negative,"This Oral B Pro 1000 toothbrush is not as well engineered as the previous version.  The handle is very slippery, especially when wet.  I have dropped the toothbrush twice already.  The ON/OFF switch is indented rather than raised, which makes it very difficult to find and turn off while using the toothbrush.  The three brushing modes are more annoying than helpful, since you generally have to cycle through them to turn off the brush.  You can press and hold the ON/OFF switch to turn off the brush, but it is awkward to do so.  If you can get past the defects, the toothbrush cleans well."
,November,2023,negative,"I've been using an Oral B electric toothbrush for years and it was time to get a new one. The only difference from the old one, is that this one is ""wrapped"" and is very difficult to turn off."
,June,2023,neutral,"I've had OralB electric toothbrushes for a few decades now and like them. I replaced my previous version because it was looking old - it was still working ok though.This new one works fine, but when I asked P&G about the 'mode' feature not seeming to work, they told me that 3791 toothbrush comes with 1 mode or 3 depending on when it was produced. It seems mine was an older version made prior to July of 2022.(If I read the date code correctly, the brush sent to me was made September 2021)Still, it works fine as did my previous ones. Recommended.I recommend that the seller should indicate that a buyer might get an older version that does not have all the features advertised."
,on,6,negative,"I had many Oral-B electric toothbrushes before, and they were excellent, but this one has a convex on/off button instead of convex, i.e. it is buried down and you have to use nails or press really hard and decisive to turn it on or off. It is probably a problem with big hands and people with small fingers do not have this problem."
,on,2,negative,"This is… fine. I previously had a Quip toothbrush, but they seemed to break after a year of use. So I wanted to jump off the Quip train and onto something else. The Oral B 1000 definitely cleans your teeth. But… it’s unusually loud, the spin and vibration are not terribly smooth, and it is difficult to turn off.  Its competitor at Phillips vibrates but does not rotate. It also has the smooth vibration and is easy to turn off. Idk how the pricier Oral B options compare. I’m still considering whether I want to return this for the Phillips."
,December,2020,positive,"quick-n-dirty:  great for use with more aggressive toothpastes that you'd only use once a day or 2-3 times a week, but too loud for twice-a-day use.  sonicare is nicer.detailed: by now, i have this Oral B 1000, an older Vitality, a Sonicare 4100, and an older Sonicare 2 Series.  the 4100 is my favourite since it's quiter, smoother, and i get a better feel of where the brush head is against my teeth.  this 1000 is certainly powerful, though, and if i use it twice-a-day my gums are unhappy so i use this one only for occasional whitening with peroxide toothpastes.  oddly enough, i have an Oral B Vitality from 4-5 years ago that's quieter, smoother, though clearly slower and less powerful - but has amazing battery life (just a hair over 70 minutes!!!)the charger is great and small, as is the toothbrush, so i guess for traveling it's fine - but why not just take a manual one!?!?  seriously, for travel, go manual.the timer works well, though i tend to brush for longer, like 4min.  i guess that's my own ""pace"", which is fine because i can still make use of the 30sec pacer to do top-left-outside, top-left-inside, bottom-left-outside, etc.  or i can spend the full 2min on just whitening the most visible teeth.overall even if clinically the Oral B is better than the Sonicare, i prefer the feel of the Sonicare, so 3 stars for you.  the price is fine, replacement brush heads (generic) are fine, but it's just too loud and racket-y considering the alternatives from Philips.  for the same approximate money, i DEFINITELY prefer the Sonicare 4100."
,on,3,negative,"I have used Sonicare for years and loved them! But I decided to try another brand after the rechargeable battery died within two years and also to try something new. So I got this one and I don’t like it at all! I thought it was a matter of getting used to something new, but it isn’t. I don’t like the head brush, it is big, yet it does not cover my whole tooth like the show in the commercial: apply it on top of your tooth and it cleans all around it, for me? Not the case, so I have to maneuver around my teeth with would not be a problem if the brush head wasn’t so big. But my biggest shock is how LOUD this is! To compare it to the Sonicare, the Oral B is like using a a blow drier vs a flat iron to do your hair!I wish I could return it but I got it about five days ago and have been using it- I was really hoping it was a matter of getting used to it. I’ll definitely go back to my prior model."
,June,2023,positive,"It’s ok, nothing special about it that I can say is worth the price compared to the regular base model. I’ve used oral b electric toothbrushes for almost 10 years now, usually the “base model” blue one with different types of heads… and this one, I can’t really tell the difference. I bought it because I thought it has a sensor to detect if you are putting too much pressure at the gums. It doesn’t have that. But I had it already so I kept it, I needed a new one anyway. In general I find the chargers don’t last. I got this last year March and now the charger is dead so I have to replace. Overall… it’s ok, just as good as the cheaper base model blue and white one."
,on,28,negative,"So I originally gave it a one star because it wasn't working . Although it deserves a one star still I cannot give it a one star. After brutally smashing the toothbrush against my bathroom counter, it started working perfectly fine. My guess is that a wire was not fitted correctly to a terminal or something of this nature. Although it's working now, still very frustrating. The lack of quality control is very common with Black Friday deals. How's the old saying goes? You get what you pay for. Most of the time. There are some good deals to be had, but it's typically not found with electronics though there are exceptions. The days of great deals on Black Friday seem to be over. The heyday of Black Friday deals where everybody flooded into the store and got amazing. Prices just isn't the same anymore.  Dead on arrival. I'm going to get another one but yeah absolutely did not work I tried everything I could think of. I usually give great reviews but once in awhile I have to give a bad review. Maybe I should get a sonicare honestly?"
,December,2023,negative,lt is actually vwery noisy compared to my old one
,on,3,negative,"This was recommended to me, but I ended up going back to Sonicare. The main reason is that the Oral-B brushhead is just too big for my mouth. I even tried the pediatric version, but it didn't help. My mouth just does not open wide enough for this. Also, it is heavier than Sonicare and very loud. Wish it had a gentler setting, too, like Sonicare. But my main problem is the size of the brushhead. So I gave it away and got a new Sonicare instead. Much happier now."
,on,24,negative,"It has an extremely annoying feature of jolt-vibrating every 30 seconds that you can't turn off. It takes 3 button presses to turn it off. It slips out of your hand when you're using it. I couldn't stand using it after a couple days. I had to buy the old Vitality version with the rubber grip, turns off after one button press, and doesn't do a 30 second reminder, only a 2 minute one. I didn't give it 1 star because it's still a toothbrush that does work as advertised."
,on,2,negative,"I've been using Oral B Vitality electric toothbrushes for many years.  They usually lasted from 2 to 3 years until the plastic stem which holds the brush wore down where it wouldn't hold the brush in place.  The battery and motor still functioned like new.I recently bought this Crossaction as a replacement.  It has a higher speed motor and works just fine.  However, it does not have the textured surface like the Vitality.  About half way through brushing, my hand gets covered in wet toothpaste draining from my mouth and it is impossible to hold onto the toothbrush any longer.  It just slides out of my hand.  I have to stop and wash the toothpaste off of the surface and then go back to brushing.  Very annoying.I need to find some type of non-slip stick on material to apply to the handle of the toothbrush."
,December,2023,positive,
,on,22,positive,"I bought one in black, and I wanted one mode: power on, power off, easy to do before removing from the mouth. That's what I got, it's great.Bought the exact same one in blue for my 78-year-old-mother, for the same reason - power on, power off, easy to manage for someone with weak hands.The blue one came with three modes. You have to press the button three times to turn it off. Exact same model number on the bottom, type 3791.So the one I got for the person who *really* needs it to be simple...isn't.Seriously? Come on."
,on,18,negative,"Not impressed,  The wire review said this was a very good brush even though it is less money.  I have difficulties with it charging.  The switch is very difficult as I have minor arthritis in my hand.  I switched from a $90 Sonicare and that was much easier to use.  I switched because the Sonicare was leaving some rather large food particles.  The different brushing mechanism on this does a better job but if it does not work because of charging why bother with it."
,on,6,positive,"This toothbrush did not function as well as I thought it would. After reading all the positive reviews, I decided that the Oral B Pro 1000 was right for me. I thought it should have cleaned more deeply and efficiently than what I experienced. After a month or more of use, I realized that I was beginning to accumulate plaque on my teeth. I have switched back to my handheld brush which is doing a sufficient job. Unfortunately, I kept it for over 30 days, so my order is not eligible for a refund."
,on,20,negative,"I have owned two basic Oral B elecric toothbrushes in the past... not the 100 USD+ ones, but basic.... I always loved them until they did not charge any longer.... This one I find no better than a drugstore battery charged e toothbrush. It is very challenging to turn on and off and so slippery to hold if you are a messy brusher...please try it out in a store before you buy to ensure it is the one for you."
,on,2,negative,"I purchased the Oral-B 1000 to replace my wife's old one, after 15 years it finely quit working, something went wrong with the on/off switch.  However there is a major difference in design, the old Oral-b had a raised switch and on the new one the switch is in a depression, very slight, but she is almost 80 and has trouble getting it on and off, if I had known I wouldn't have purchased it."
,on,24,positive,"The toothbrush worked great and held charge for days like it said in the instructions. i bought this toothbrush from Amazon on Jan 4th 2023. And about a week ago (May 17th 2023) I recharged it to full and now it will not hold charge through one brushing. i tried to recharge multiple times and it does the same thing over and over again. I have had good success with multiple Oral B products, but I really do not want to spend another $50 only after 4.5 months of lifetime on this toothbrush. Ugh!"
,on,2,negative,"11/2023: Purchased this brush late March & it’s dead as of mid-November. My disposable electric toothbrushes lasted longer than this thing. I will not purchase it again.I have had plenty of electric toothbrushes but never one with a round head. I chose the round head to force me to concentrate on each tooth versus just time for each quarter of my mouth. This brush has a 15 sec timer to nudge you along and as mentioned, the round head helps you focus on working on each tooth/gumline. My dental exams have improved, not to mention my gums. Replacement heads are easy and affordable to come by. My only complaint is that the wand is huge and the unit is loud. Other than that, you can’t beat the price for what you get."
,October,2023,negative,"I don't know if it's an issue with this practical style of braun electric toothbrush but it takes forever to recharged.  Otherwise, it works like any other Braun."
,on,14,negative,"I bought this to replace an older Oral B. Like many others have commented, it is hard to turn on and off. There is absolutely no excuse for Oral B to put this on the market KNOWING it was hard. Folks, this is where they get the phrase PROFIT OVER PEOPLE! I'm sure the company must have saved money by putting in a cheap, hard to press switch. I'll never buy another Oral B!"
