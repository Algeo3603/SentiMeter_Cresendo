2.0,January,2024,negative,"I've used it and got little results. Could be used for a month but don't use it regularly (my dentist also recommended the same) as it would decay your enamle. If your teeths are very yellow then go for some Desi jugads (home made remidies) or consult your dentist. It won't fully brighten your teeth but would give some result. Overall, could be used for a month or less but do not even think of using it regularly :)"
