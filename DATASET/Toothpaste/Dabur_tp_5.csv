1.0,November,2023,negative,Taste and smell is so bad that sometimes I feel vomit it out even if the smell/paste enters deeper into mouth.
3.0,October,2023,positive,"I used buy Red always, thought of trying neem and to my dismay this paste is average and awful taste, doesnt feel like a neem paste, more like a cream used for Cakes."
