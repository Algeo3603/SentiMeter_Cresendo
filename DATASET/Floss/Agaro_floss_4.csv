4.0,January,2024,positive,"This is a great dental flosser for the price. It has two cleaning modes (Clean and Massage) and ten pressure settings, so you can customize it to your comfort level. The 600ml water tank is also a good size, so you don't have to refill it too often.The flosser can be a bit noisy, especially on the higher pressure settings.Overall, I would recommend this flosser to anyone looking for an affordable and effective way to floss their teeth. Just be aware of the few quirks that I mentioned.The flosser is currently on sale for 58% off. This is a great deal, so if you're considering buying this flosser, I would recommend doing so now.I hope this helps!I've been using this flosser for a few weeks now, and I'm overall happy with it. My teeth feel cleaner and my gums seem healthier."

5.0,January,2024,positive,Just received. I will write full review in few months. The quality seems good. It is smaller than expected which is good as it can be handle better now.
3.0,December,2023,positive,The product is good but making a continous beep sound while using.
4.0,December,2023,positive,Good product.  The water tank washer leaked and needed careful handling. Spare washer should be given as standard.  Additional types of Nozzles will be useful.  Hope spares are available if needed.
5.0,December,2023,positive,"it can clean teeth no problem, very powerful, careful with pressure on max settings"
