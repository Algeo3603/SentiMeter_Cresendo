5.0,February,2024,positive,I earliar used the oral b essential floss and Colgate floss and both of them had plastic string which caused bleeding inside the gums. This one is very soft and is professional in quality and does not injure the gums. This was made in USA and oral b should make the same thing available in India. Excellent quality and must buy. This is what floss should be like. Good minty taste as well. Does not shred.

5.0,January,2024,negative,"It's a request to Oral-B that please stop the production of your normal floss ""ESSENTIAL"" which is actually a thread and keep the ""PRO EXPERT"" one at a moderate price."
5.0,January,2024,positive,This floss is good but overpriced. I wish they priced it less than 250 rupees.

5.0,December,2023,positive,Undoubtedly the best floss I’ve used. Little overpriced though.
5.0,November,2023,positive,If you use this floss you will not look back. This is the best floss in Indian market. Alternatives like Colgate and Oral-B for Indian market just suck infront of this
5.0,October,2023,positive,Quality of the thread is excellent which is the single most important element of the dental floss. Used for the first time and I’m mighty happy with the product. Slightly expensive but go ahead and buy as Colgate total floss has become worse.
