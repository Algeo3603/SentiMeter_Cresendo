5.0,February,2024,positive,Nice
1.0,February,2024,neutral,Doesn't actually rotate
4.0,February,2024,negative,Using for a month and color of the britsle is faded half through it. Which is a technic to fool customers to change the britsle. And buy 2 of them for 450. But now it is selling for 799 which is acceptable price. But you should not wash the whole brush very often or you will lose the whole brush.try to wipe it instead of washing it.
5.0,February,2024,positive,Good Product yielding enriched results.Delivery time ofcourse long.Full value of money.Popular Brand.Colour combination is also good
2.0,February,2024,negative,Review after 6 months of usage . Better not buy this one because the major drawback is it is not rechargeable. You have to change the battery s within 20 days . If it is Duracell then it will last a bit more . The battery will cost 25 rupees for 25 days and for 2 brush head cost 490 rupees . There is a duplicate (8 for 490) option but it is very slow which won't give a proper cleaning. At first we feel like it's a great deal but it's not .
4.0,February,2024,neutral,"Expected better product, not complaining, battery life hardly one month,,,"
1.0,February,2024,negative,Its dead now after 1 and a half years of usage. Colgate sonic brush is better which is older than Oral B and is still functional.

3.0,February,2024,positive,It's very good liked the product cleans tooth very nicely....
