5.0,February,2024,positive,"Perfora has done a really good job with this product. Pricing is reasonably cheaper in this segment, this is a must-try for everyone. The focus is truly on the customer experience and of course oral health.Conscious choice of ingredients that go into the toothpaste is also commendable. All in all, an easy recommendation."

4.0,February,2024,positive,"So, it has been almost 10 days since I've been using this and I'm gonna say it's pretty good. My dentist adviced me to switch to an electric toothbrush so after an hour of scrolling, I decided to buy this one.The bristles are soft, if you do not apply a lot of pressure it definitely does a great job at picking out stuff from inbetween your teeth (the stuff that you cannot even pick out with a toothpick easily or even with your normal toothbrush after vigorously brushing your teeth with it) and it looks very pretty (looks a lot better than the pictures on the product page, hehe)It comes with 2 brush heads, a body and one AAA battery. It also has IPX7 which makes it truly waterproof, the other ones which I found while browsing (at this price range) did not come with IPX7, they were just water resistant.Can't say anything about the battery life as it has just been 10 days but I'll surely update my review regarding that later.The only problem I've faced is switching modes because of which I'm rating this a 4 star (would've rated 4.5 if possible) otherwise it's a great toothbrush at this price range."

4.0,February,2024,positive,It was a nice experience using perfora toothbrush for the first time. I experienced numbness as mentioned in the manual but my mouth feels cleaner and brush time is reduced to only 2 minutes. It is compact lightweight and ergonomic. I observed that my mouth feels cleaner than when using normal brushes. Must buy for those who are worried about their oral health. This product is definitely worth.
