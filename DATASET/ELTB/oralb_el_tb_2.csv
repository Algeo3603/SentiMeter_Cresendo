1.0,February,2024,negative,"Battery stopped working after a week, unable to return or replace the brush."
2.0,February,2024,positive,Bought it in November 2023 and writing the review in Feb 2024. So yeah used it well before commenting.It’s a good electric tooth brush with 2 modes. Costlier compared to other available ones.Cons: no charging indicator. So you have no idea how many hours you need to chargeThe replacement heads cost rs.500 per pair and it lasts for 2 months.So the strategy is sell the brush at 1500 and charge 250 per month for replacement heads.Definitely wouldnt recommend.
1.0,February,2024,neutral,Not working it’s been only 2 days. No replacement warranty. No customer care number. Can anyone help?
3.0,February,2024,positive,"Doesn't have any indicator for battery, is waterproof and motor is strong. More features could have been added at this price point. But for quality I would recommend."

3.0,January,2024,neutral,There is no charging indicator
4.0,January,2024,positive,Bit puts pressure on teeth. Manual says 30 secs. x 4 = 2 mins. of brushing. But that is less.Otherwise Teeth cleaning is very good
