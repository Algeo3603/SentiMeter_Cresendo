1.0,January,2024,positive,"Read the review if you want to know how the product is but the one star is because you need to send them a proof of review for the company to register warranty.It's been 2 days and the for 700+ ruppes you can't ask for more.Colour is beautiful, product feels sturdy and premium enough.Comes with a cheap dc 5v usb charger but atleast it's usb. For this price range you can't ask for more.Only ick is if they had a plug for the charger hole (image 3) so that water dosent seep inside. Vibration dosent feel strong as 1.5k ones but for this price range this is the best you're gonna get. Vs the spark one id say this is better in quality but for vibrations spark one is slightly better"

5.0,December,2023,positive,"Been using this toothbrush for almost 3 months now,lemme tell you the quality and build of it is awesome. It has the perfect weight, feels solid and even has 3 modes, doesnâ€™t vibrate at all.You can use the sensitive mode for cleaning your tounge too. Overall works like a charm and the charge lasts  for pretty damn long.Completely recommend it.A separate button for changing modes would make the user experience a bit more easy than yanking the power button for everything ðŸ˜…"
