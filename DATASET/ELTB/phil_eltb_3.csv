3.0,February,2024,negative,"I am reviewing this after using it for 8 months. My experience is mixed. Its sleek design is attractive and battery life is good. With usage of daily once , till now I have charged it only once after first 3 months.However the sound level has tremendously increased after 3 months even in the slow option. With the brush head fixed, the sound is high enough to be an irritant. The USP of Sonicare being silence, I didn’t find it to be true.Also, the feature of brush head replacement warning didn’t happen even once. Not sure if this feature actually exists even if claimed"
1.0,January,2024,negative,"Please dont buy, the replacement heads are so expensive. 1200rs per piece and can use only 3 months. Check the replacement brush head price before you buy."
5.0,November,2023,positive,Good Product
5.0,November,2023,positive,Simply amazing . The big problem however is getting replacement brush heads. As brushheads  not even available on Amazon and Philips India.

5.0,September,2023,negative,Cleaning teeth
5.0,August,2023,positive,I know I get a good and thorough cleaning in 3 minutes.No more wasting time with a manual brush and I don't have to worry about applying too much pressure either.Only thing I don't know who can use the high setting on this brush without hurting the gums. Seems way too intense.
5.0,May,2023,positive,Great product. Effective.Don’t buy cheap brushes. Invest in an expensive one like this you’ll experience the difference
4.0,March,2023,positive,"Very good brushing experience, cleans all nook and corner. Teeth feel cleaner and smooth.Very good battery lifeCons -Too CostlyReplacements heads are not available or are sold at 5x prices."
4.0,March,2023,positive,This is pathetic brush as it stops charging after 2 month of use and brand has no warrantee. My old agaro brush worked for 3 years even on 1/3rd of price. Pathetic quality from phillips.
