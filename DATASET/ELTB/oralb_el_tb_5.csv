2.0,September,2023,negative,Battery lasts for 2 days..Single speed(powerful).not good for daily use..It should be with different modes.I paid around 8000..it doesn't have any box
4.0,August,2023,positive,Does not have options for modes. Plus if the pressure is high it just pauses but does emit a sound. Otherwise ok.
1.0,March,2023,negative,"If it is being shipped to India, the least they can do is to give a charger for 220V.  My charger stopped working in seconds.  Only when I looked at the rating closely it says 100-150V"
