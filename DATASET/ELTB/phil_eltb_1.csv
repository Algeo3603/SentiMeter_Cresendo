5.0,January,2024,negative,The product carries a two year warranty . In less than a year it stopped working. Still worse the service is very bad . They promptly provided a complaint number and promised service within four hours . No one showed up for the next four days . On contact they again promised immediate attention. Another four days and still no one has turned up .The product is bad and the service is non existent.
3.0,December,2023,negative,"I am writing this review after one year of use. Power button went nuts. It starts and shuts down randomly. Silicon button got peeled away. Other than that, it does the job well.I own couple of philips products. I observed they stopped working right after warranty period or just before warranty period. So, They wont last long. Don't pay premium on cheap products. Better buy other cheap products which promises quality.I am planning to buy a new one after a year of use."
5.0,December,2023,positive,the only problem is that we have to purchase 3rd party replacements otherwise the product is great
5.0,November,2023,neutral,I bet you will never switch back after using this.
1.0,October,2023,negative,"After using this device for over three months, I can confidently say that it's an excellent product that functions exceptionally well. Initially, I was hesitant about investing in an expensive toothbrush. However, electric brushes clearly have the advantage of being gentle on the gums. They operate by brushing your teeth thousands of times within a brief period â€“ a speed our hands can't achieve. Moreover, they provide focused cleaning rather than prolonged brushing against the gums and tooth roots, thus preventing gum damage.However, I'm deeply disappointed by the unavailability of official replacement heads. I reached out to Philips Customer Care, and while they did ask for my phone number, they never followed up. I'm not comfortable purchasing third-party parts.Given the cost and the lack of support, I regret my purchase. I wish I had explored other brands that offer replacement heads as well."

1.0,October,2023,negative,Do not buy within 3 months of use it started to malfunction and customer service is very poor service center told they will give a replacement but after 3 month still not received the product so approached consumer court
1.0,October,2023,negative,"Searched high & low, all Philips service centres, spoke to their customer care & what not, no replacement head available for this model, perhaps that's why it's cheap!!! Don't fall info this trap, after 6-8months you'll have to throw the brush away!"
5.0,October,2023,positive,Good product for teeth cleaning. 2 minutes cleaning ensure that your teeth are cleaned thoroughly. Slightly overpriced product.
