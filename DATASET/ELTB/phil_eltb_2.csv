5.0,January,2024,positive,Extremely effective in cleaning the teeth.
1.0,November,2023,neutral,No speed or pressure control. Can damage to teeths.no return policy. Don't waste money.
1.0,September,2023,neutral,The battery just gave up after a month. The product initially worked fine but now it barely lasts 2 minutes no matter how much i charge it. Please donâ€™t buy from amazon as the return policy is not available after a month.
5.0,July,2023,positive,"I'm using this for the past 20 days. firstly if you are a newbie then it's definitely gonna trouble you for the first 2-4 uses after that you gonna used to it and enjoy your daily toothbrushing more than your normal toothbrush.cleaning: 5/5when it's come to cleaning it's just amazing it will do all the work for you in just two min but make sure you cover all the areas in two min.battery charging: 4/5it will take approximately 12 hr to get from 0-100% (but the wait is worthðŸ˜Š)battery discharging: 4.5/5company says that it will last 14 days but nah, it lasts 10-12 days which is also not badcomfort: 3.5/5it's a bit heavy but you will used to it after a few uses and as it was a Sonic toothbrush it can easily go through your mouth, unlike an oscillation toothbrush.finally brush 2 times a day and be healthy."
3.0,June,2023,positive,"So I purchased this a week ago, it was a very weird experience for the first day as it was my first time using an electric toothbrush, after that i kinda Started liking it, although i purchased this because it had Pressure Sensor which i thought might be helpful if in case I put too much pressure.But it requires too much pressure for it to activate, and most probably no one brushes their teeth like this!So instead i will suggest people to buy Philis toothbrush but cheaper one( Yes i know it gives more strokes but well now it's upto you do decide what you want )"
2.0,June,2023,negative,I found this brush vibrating too much. The whole system just vibrates. Very inconvenient. Accindentaly the back side plastic sometimes touches the teeth and it hurts. Gums hurt. I don't know why people are writing so positive about this product . 2 star is enough.
1.0,April,2023,positive,"The brush is good, got refill once and was around 1200 for pack of 2, now can't even find them and the only listing is 6k for pack of 5 I couldn't get the replacement in my local offline market. Please check availability of replacement heads before purchasing."
5.0,March,2023,positive,"Good one! Battery life is good, easy to use and clean"
1.0,March,2023,positive,"The product itself is excellent, definitely 5 STAR.But NO replacement head is available anywhere. I have tried all major online platforms and a few Phillipes retail stores. But No clue where to find it in India. A few options on Amazon are more expensive than the whole Brush assembly itself. And some non-genuine options are also available but I don't want to take risks with my teeth."
