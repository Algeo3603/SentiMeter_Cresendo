3.0,February,2024,positive,Working power reduced after a month
4.0,February,2024,positive,"This Oral-B Pro 3 is a pretty good all round electric toothbrush. All the basic features which I could want at this price point, but I still think it is over-priced. I think I bought it for ‚Çπ2800. But I like the feel of it and the finer control in the cleaning action, compared to Philip Sonicare."
4.0,February,2024,positive,"Once charged, it will work for 3 or 4 days and it's effective."
5.0,February,2024,positive,"Quality and purpose, recommended"
3.0,February,2024,negative,"Panny, an unbaised reviewerDoes it clean your teeth better than a manual toothbrush? Ofcourse this will be much better than a manual toothbrush butThe toothbrush feels like a kids toy in hand, the material finishing is really bad, the colourway is very awkward, the toothbrush is awkwardly very loud, despite the loudness the motor is not powerful enough to justify the noise. The battery is decent. A bit overpriced for 3k."
1.0,February,2024,negative,"If you want to turn off immediately, you cannot. You need to press the button three times. I'm not sure why the red light is blinking. It seems like the product is damaged."
5.0,February,2024,positive,Great üëç
4.0,February,2024,negative,"toothbrush does it's work, you'll feel thoroughly clean and fresh, the only drawback is the amount of noise it produces and it doesn't have automatic switching off mechanism after two minutes"
4.0,January,2024,positive,Good battery life. Haven‚Äôt faced issues of electrical shock and such (as of yet). Gets the job done
1.0,January,2024,negative,"I am writing this review after using it for 10 months. My toothbrush has stopped working after just 10 months of using it though the product says they provide a guarantee for 2 years ! The device is not charging, therefore not sure if the charger or the electric tooth brush itself has stopped working ! The service center given on the oral b website for Kolkata doesn‚Äôt even service oral B , they haven‚Äôt bothered to update the service center ! So now I am stuck and I have to invest in another electronic toothbrush again ! Never buying Oral B"
