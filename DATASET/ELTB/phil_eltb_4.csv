3.0,October,2023,negative,"I have been using Philips Sonicare product from 2004...most of the brushes survive for 18-24 months...finally, tried this new product hoping this can be useful instead of the expensive short lasting products... but the brash head and the oscillating frequency is not good...disappointed..."
3.0,August,2023,neutral,Travel case is not included in the package. It should have been mentioned clearly.
2.0,July,2023,positive,"Brush is really good, but can't find the replaceable heads, so buying it is not much worthy. Battery backup is amazing."
1.0,July,2023,negative,It is not comfortable for me to see that package is opened & sent without seal . When I use a personal care product I want to be assured that it is not tampered with. As the product is working fine I am not returning this item . But I’m not happy with the state it was delivered in
5.0,June,2023,positive,No doubt at all.
