2.0,February,2024,negative,"It flares very fast, say, after a month or two, so there is no point in using this product, as there is no value for money, a toothbrush should last atleast 3 months"
1.0,February,2024,negative,"Do not buy it even if was given for free, it hurts mouth and gums. Even after 3 hours I still feel it! One toothbrush costs around 20 rupees, and I have used toothbrushes that this cheap from local brands and even the one Colgate gives for free with toothpaste. Nothing was bad than this.The hard bristles literally impales cheek tissues and gums, horrible horrible stuff, I'm throwing this away in trash."
