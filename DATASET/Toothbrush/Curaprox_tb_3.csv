1.0,June,2023,negative,"The bristles are spoilt and spread in just one use, very bad experience with this purchase."
1.0,March,2023,negative,Its not meant for adults Also it doesn’t clean well because its so small
1.0,November,2022,negative,"The model in the video discription is well above the age of 18 and the discription says the product is made for every one above the age of 5. Which includes adults as well. However this brush is not made for adults. The head of the brush is too small for adults. If i were to buy it from a local store I'd not buy it! Given that I could visually compare it to other toothbrush. But since this is an online shopping website. Such comparisons cannot be made by the customer. In which case it's on the seller to vividly & clearly discribe the size of the head of the toothbrush. And provide a visual comparison in photo discription. For a toothbrush that's 500 INR, I'd expect more transperency. This is utterly misleading! And not acceptable. Period!"
2.0,November,2022,negative,"Didn’t open the brush for a long period. When I did, I realised the brush is really small for children not for adults."
5.0,April,2021,positive,Worlds softest toothbrush invented by scientists. Your gums will surely love this brush. It can cleans the last teeth which mostly toothbrush are unable to do. I use this with hydroxyapatite tooth paste.
2.0,September,2020,negative,This is my third curaprox toothbrush but this time i got disappointed. The size of brush is too small. Probably its a kid’s toothbrush and there is no exchange or return option available
1.0,March,2019,negative,This product is not returnable is very small as compared to the picture mentioned. Do not order this product please. Amazon service is zero now.
5.0,December,2018,neutral,"I have been using these for past 9 months (got offline, not from Amazon). These are best manual toothbrushes you can get in India for now. I was amazed to see it available online on Amazon and order immediately. The bristles are soft and they clean your teeth effectively. Soft brushes from Colgate etc. don't stand a chance in front of these. Do a favour to your teeth and order these."
4.0,November,2018,positive,Nice
