5.0,July,2020,positive,"Excellent toothpaste. I've been using it for two years. While other toothpastes in the Indian market actually cause more tooth ache, I find Sensodyne is very genuine and cleans well. The ""Fresh mint"" variant is my preference. Perfect for sensitive teeth."
4.0,July,2020,positive,Very strong effect due to cleansing power of the paste . And it is not advised for people who are sensitive to strong chemicals. extensive use may give skin peeling or picking effect on inner lips. Sensodyne Repair and protect is better than this product.
2.0,June,2020,negative,"bruising effect on jaw & teeth,iching & burning effect"
5.0,June,2020,positive,"kind of expensive, but the only toothpaste where i saw a visible different in the teeth color and reduction in stain marks on my teeth. highly recommended, a little pricey but does the job which other toothpastes don't."
