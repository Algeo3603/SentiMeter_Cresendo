5.0,February,2024,positive,I have sensitive gums plus a few fillings in my back teeth. This toothbrush has soft bristles thus gives a very soft touch while brushing. It cleans effectively and the quality of toothbrush is very good. I have been using it since a month and it still works the same way.
5.0,February,2024,positive,My dentist recommended me brush with smaller head so that it reaches till wisdom teeth. This brush was a game changer for me. It's very soft and the grip is so good. With small head it reaches all areas. But the bristles should be a little short like the normal brushes.
