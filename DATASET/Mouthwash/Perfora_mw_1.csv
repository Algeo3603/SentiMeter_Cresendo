4.0,February,2024,positive,"I had used mouthwash from different brands, but this one has found a place in my toiletries. This has a good flavour, but it does leave a mild bitter taste at the end for some time. Rest of the stuff is good. No fragrance, no colors, no burning sensation ofc. As someone with sensitive tongue, this does the work for me.Thanks to Amazon recommends."
