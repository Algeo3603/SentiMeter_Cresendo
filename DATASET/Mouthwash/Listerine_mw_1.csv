4.0,February,2024,negative,"Listerine Cool Mint Mouthwash definitely leaves your mouth feeling clean and refreshed. However, the intensity of the minty flavor can be a bit much for some people.Pros: Germ-fighting power:  There's no denying that Listerine does that powerful ""clean feeling"" that  indicates it's working hard at killing germs. Long-lasting freshness: The minty sensation will linger for a good amount of time after use. Value pack: Getting three bottles is a decent deal if you know you'll use them all.Cons: Overpowering mint: Some may find the initial coolness almost burning; it can be harsh on sensitive mouths. Leaves a dry feeling: It can leave your mouth feeling dry after extended use. Preference-based: If you don't enjoy very strong mint, this isn't the mouthwash for you.Overall: Listerine Cool Mint is effective at giving your mouth a deep clean and refreshing feeling.  However, if you have a sensitive mouth or aren't a fan of intense mint flavors, be aware that this might not be the best option.  Those who can tolerate the strong flavor will likely be happy with the cleaning power!"
