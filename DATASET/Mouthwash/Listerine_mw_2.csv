5.0,December,2023,positive,It's very good product. Ofcourse it's effectiveness would be visible after use of little longer period.
5.0,October,2023,positive,ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ
4.0,September,2023,negative,"Kinda harsh on the mouth tissue, burns a fair bit due to the alcohol content.The biggest issue seems to be the smell of the dried mouthwash (on the bottle) which is similar to dried saliva.Maybe an issue with particular batches but no issues with the delivery from the seller or the overall quality of the product.Try the cool mint option, milder and doesn't have this issue with product smell."
4.0,August,2023,positive,"Good but contains alcohol, alcohol makes your teeth pale to brown. So your dentist say you to throw it."
5.0,August,2023,positive,Perfect to prevent cavities and effective enough to avoid infections.
5.0,July,2023,negative,I have been using Listerine Cavity fighter for the last 10 years and must say that it has kept me away from root canal problems during this period. I sometimes wish I had started using it much earlier. It may not be 100% protection from serious dental issues that arise but it surely minimises the detriortaion rate and so helps one postpone the visit to a dentistwould recommend youngsters to start using it everyday.  I must emphasize that I only use the cavity fighter.  I have no experience with other listerine mouth wash products
