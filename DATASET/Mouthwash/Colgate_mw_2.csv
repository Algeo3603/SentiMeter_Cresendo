1.0,December,2023,positive,"Its weird not sweet , not bubblegum, but medicine like.I trusted the brand and went for this. It tastes weird. The CLOSEUP mouthwash series of clove & spice is good , Listerine is Best but Maxfresh is super weird. Never buying again."

3.0,November,2023,positive,The product is average.  I have used listerine.  I can clearly view the difference.  This product needs to be more long lasting.  Not as potent as listerine
