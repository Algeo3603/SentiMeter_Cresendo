3.0,November,2023,negative,"I have extremely sensitive gums and this product is advertised as ultrasoft but it's not it's the same as the others, this causes discomfort and hurts my gums, so far the only good thing good about these is that they're a little broad which mean that I don't have to shift the toothbrush up and down while brushing but that's about it, they aren't soft at all, wish I could return them"
3.0,December,2023,positive,"MUMUSO has a similar , cheaper and better product."
2.0,October,2023,negative,"The brush used to be good when it was initially launched. Off late, it's become really bad. The size of each bristle is different and some of them are sharp and hard. Either we are getting defective products or the company changed its design of the bristles. The latest brushes hurt my gums and caused  bleeding. I suggest not to buy it."
3.0,August,2023,negative,Brush is very soft.
3.0,July,2021,positive,"The reason I bought this is because of thr word enamel protection as my mom had issues with her enamel.4 brushes for Ra.240 is definitely the real price and in my opinion I won't think it as a buy 2 get 2 free marketing. The price is on the higher end of it's really a buy 2 get 2.The pink color is repetitive. I wish all 4 tooth brush had different colors and a tad darker than current one as current one in morning light looks very pale.The brush is definitely very soft and extra wide. The extra wide is helping cleaning all sides of the teeth better and is also not harsh.But in all the new series of colgate tooth brushes like the extra foam, enamel protection series am seeing a couple of bristles at the bottom end of the brush head in a slanting position or bend at angle, I see it might be a manufacturing issue. Out of 4 brushes 2 had this issue where 3 or 4 bristles were not straight.The density is good enough and all bristles had good thin edges.Overall a good toothbrush but pricing is high, colors could have been different and all bristles should be straight"
1.0,January,2021,negative,"I am writing this review after using this variant of Toothbrush for approximately 2 months. Obviously purchased these after seeing 4.5 rating for this product, but there is nothing special about this toothbrush for sure.* This brush is supposed to have Ultra-Soft bristles, which are usually advised to people with sensitivity in their mouth, in my experience, the bristles were medium-soft and as you start to use them down the week, they turn to medium. I tried to clear up the residue by soaking the bristles in baking soda, but sadly this did not happen. So please don't fall prey to false advertising, this brush has medium-soft bristles.* The product claims to be gentle on gums but owing to the above reason, I don't see how this is possible.* The bristles are arranged in plateau layout or simply arranged in a flat with no raised bristles at the tip of the toothbrush which makes it impossible to clean the hard to reach places of your upper molars, this means if you are using this brush, forget about getting 100% clean teeth. I could actually feel a plaque build-up in places where I knew the bristles are not able to reach.* The neck of the toothbrush is not flexible enough, even cheap toothbrushes have better maneuvering than this toothbrush.* This toothbrush just looks fancy but sadly it did not work for me as of yet!Giving it 1 star for the build quality."
1.0,February,2024,positive,

2.0,August,2023,positive,Average product
3.0,May,2022,positive,"tooth brush is very soft and suitable for usinf it on gums and one of the most soft i have ever used.but if you use it regularly without using other toothbrush (medium) along with this, you will see deposits on your teeth."
1.0,October,2023,negative,"Opposite of marketing.Try to brush your front teeth unless you’re doing something really crazy it’s gonna touch your gums and it hurts on the gums.Regardless of that the size is still quite uncomfortable, so brushing the wisdom teeth and the shape does not fit comfortably."
3.0,December,2021,positive,Product bristles are not that soft like how seller's or colgate it self are portraying. Bristles are not too hard nor too soft.. just ok like sensodin toothbrush. They're talking high money just because of the classy and royal look of the product.
3.0,October,2022,neutral,It is not ultra soft . It's same  like other toothbrush .....
2.0,March,2023,negative,"Structure of bristles is plain which does not clean the plaque easily from inner side of teeth, have to usea lot of pressure which defeated the purpose of soft bristles."
3.0,February,2022,positive,Brush is soft and feeling nice to use. But everytime is coming with only 3 color in the box. 1 color is always repeats it’s a frustrating issue for a family of 4.
3.0,August,2021,negative,"I expected soft. But it is somewhere between soft and medium. The width is wide, so your u get good contact with the entire tooth and a bit of fun area as well.It is not very soft. It feels little dense. Not too happy.The handle is good. The rear tounge cleaner is not there."

3.0,May,2021,negative,This feels like a tooth brush for kids. I am used to have more bristles so more of your teeth get brushed with every stroke. I need to spend more time than normal and I do not like it.

2.0,February,2023,positive,Tooth brush head is wider than usual
1.0,April,2023,positive,"The bristle not changed, but the handle is changed, I liked this brush because of it’s soft bristles and grippy handle, but handle is not same anymore. It’s back side now comes in plastic instead of grip. please redesign it back, @colgate if you are reading this. This was my favourite type of brush… but not anymore."
